Unfortunately, the argument for this supposed early Babylonian planetary order depends on Kugler's discussion (Kugler 1907, 13-14) of only three sources: K.4386 (formerly II R 48, a Neo-Assyrian copy of the lexical text ur5-ra = hubullu; description available on BM website), K.2067 (formerly III R 57, a Neo-Assyrian duplicate or relative to the \"Great Star List\"; description available on BM website), and BM 33066 (formerly Strassmaier Cambyses 400, a Neo-Babylonian astronomical text whose arrangement Kugler imperfectly understood; description available on BM website).

In the first [122] she turns her attention to the question of how far the Ptolemies were responsible for the monetisation of Egypt. She notes the extent to which Egypt was already monetised in the dynastic period, stressing the use of money of account and the use of this in circles where physical forms of money did not in fact circulate, and the ability of different social strata to participate in the resulting monetary economy. Set against this background, the introduction of coinage into Egypt can be seen as restrictive rather than enabling. For this reason, and because of the weakness of local silver supplies, the local economy of Egypt, she suggests, continued to operate on a money of account basis, which may in turn account for the observable instability of ratios between silver (interstate currency) and bronze (epichoric). In the second [123] she develops this idea of dichotomy in the monetary instruments of Ptolemaic Egypt, by stressing on the one hand the symbolic value of high-value precious metal coinages, and on the other the ability of the chora to function economically in the absence of physical monetary instruments. ROWLANDSON too [110] has emphasised the extent to which the coin in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt can be deeply embedded within existing non-coin monetary practice, such as to make its form almost incidental.\u21a9#p29\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/2/#p30\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "BOGAERT has produced two further studies on the workings of banks in Ptolemaic Egypt.

The supposition of a dislocation between the two \u2018standards\u2019, imposed by the Ptolemaic rulers from the reign of Philopator onwards seemed a necessary conclusion to be drawn from the escalating bronze prices observable in the papyri from this period onwards. This assumption has lain behind the book length attempt by MARESCH [98] to establish the relative values of bronze and silver throughout the history of Graeco-Roman Egypt. His discussion is unfortunately compromised in some of its detail by various assumptions concerning the bronze coinage, arrived at in collaboration with W. Weiser that seem at best questionable. LORBER [300] in her review of the latter author\u2019s catalogue of the Cologne collection, and in her other publications on the third century bronze (see above), has highlighted some of the problems. Nonetheless MARESCH\u2019s basic conclusion, that the silver and bronze standards were unified under Ptolemy II and then became dislocated under Philopator may well be close to the truth. The question of the relationship between the pre- and post-reform bronze of Philadelphus remains moot, however. That the steep rise in prices was the result of dirigiste policy on the part of the Ptolemaic rulers has recently been called into question, however, by CADELL and LE RIDER [72]. Instead of seeing in the price rise a reaction to a devaluation of the bronze coinage, they suggest that the rise in prices may simply have been the result of inflation, due to an increase in the money-supply. Certainly, on the basis of the grain prices they trace over the third and early 2nd century BC, the inflation seems not to be as regular or extreme as earlier theories of royal intervention have postulated. The rupture between the silver and bronze standards was a reaction to this price inflation: an attempt by the administration to maintain the price of grain for the foreign market by fixing it in silver drachms, and allowing the bronze in use in the chora to find its own level against this. Whether an increase in money supply could have been sufficient to cause inflation at the level at which it occurred, remains a matter of uncertainty: doubt is cast on this by BAGNALL [291]. HUSTON and LORBER [178] add further doubts about the mechanism adopted by the authorities to deal with the inflation. They suggest that, in the monetary reform they have identified in the reign of Ptolemy IV, there may be evidence for an attempt on the part of the government to demonetise old coin stock and reduce the money supply. It remains unclear whether the obvious reductions in weight standard now identified by LORBER and HUSTON [291] in the reigns of Ptolemies IV and V were solely reactive, or whether they were part of the driving force behind inflation at this period.

Currency itself was an expression of sovereignty, as was the imposition of its use, effected through tax laws and through the introduction of Greek financial institutions, especially banks and tax farming. Early Lagid economic policy was designed to ensure stability and predictability, to insulate the treasury from risk, and only then to capture as much revenue as possible through taxation; the result was an economic intensification that eventually contributed to rural unrest. Within this framework, Manning discusses specific taxes required in cash; the codification of the legal traditions of the various ethnic communities; the role of temples in the monetized economy; use of cash by the native Egyptians; and loans, interest rates, and the limitations of the credit market. In a chapter on the relevance of Ptolemaic Egypt for studies of \u201cthe ancient economy,\u201d VON REDEN [120] characterizes coinage and contracts as economic institutions whose introduction, in combination with Ptolemaic royal ideology and rituals, served to integrate Egypt both politically and economically while stimulating economic growth. The papyrological evidence implies widespread commercial exchange within Egypt; however this was not a Greek market driven by individual profit seeking but rather one in which many individuals were motivated by ideals of service to the monarchy and ambition for positions of power at the court or in local hierarchies. The major purpose of the salt tax was to compel circulation of the king\u2019s coinage and to force the population into paid labor contracts. Local taxes collected in bronze coinage were recycled locally through paid labor, especially for maintenance of the irrigation system (under the Ptolemies, even compulsory labor was paid by the local administration or set off against taxes). Von Reden mentions papyrological evidence for royal financial problems under Ptolemy IV, describes his monetary reform, and refers to the subsequent redefinition of the bronze drachm as \u201cthe stater of an independent currency.\u201d The problems of the late third century indicate that the cohesion of the economy did not emanate from economic mechanisms alone, but depended importantly on the authority and charisma of the king, which was maintained through extensive public ritual, aimed at both Greek and Egyptian subjects, in which coinage played a part.\u21a9#p36\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/2/#p37\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "VON REDEN\u2019S book on money in the Ptolemaic economy [121] is, like the two preceding studies, limited to the third century, and develops many of the same themes, but in much greater detail. Two chapters are devoted to the evolution of the coinage, covering familiar ground but also offering fresh ideas and useful information from the field of papyrology. The early coinage was linked to the legitimization of Lagid rule, with gold coinage in particular associated with state payments and royal cult. Precious metal coins were aimed at Alexandria, the harbors, and the economy of cleruchs, while bronze coins were intended for the ch\u00f4ra; although they were exchangeable, these were essentially separate currencies, hoarded separately and usually separated in accounts. By the 230s precious metal coins had largely disappeared from the ch\u00f4ra, and exchange between silver and bronze currency became a matter of negotiation and local policy, apparently controlled by royal banks. Monetization was uneven and in the ch\u00f4ra it could only be maintained by an extensive system of credit. Under these circumstances prices were not sensitive to money supply, so that the inflation of the late third century cannot be explained by an oversupply of coinage or a shortage of goods. (This conclusion ignores the current tendency of economists to consider credit as part of the money supply and the recent painful lessens that credit can indeed lead to price inflation.) Von Reden critically reviews the documentary evidence for the inflation of the late third century and suggests that the disappearance of monopoly banks (responsible for money changing) after the reign of Ptolemy III and of the salt tax after 217 may have contributed to a piecemeal disintegration of the monetary system under Ptolemy IV, which culminated in the removal of most bronze coinage from circulation. (In contrast, CLARYSSE AND THOMPSON [73] submit that the salt tax continued to be levied to the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty, and that the lack of records is an accident of survival.) A sixty-fold elevation in wages toward the end of the century indicates that bronze coinage had become an independent currency in which the bronze drachm served as a unit of account equivalent to one sixtieth of the silver drachm, consistent with the traditional Egyptian silver : bronze ratio of 1 : 60. The earliest unequivocal attestation of the new system is P. Tebt. III 829, dated 201. Another chapter details the exchange of bronze and silver and the circumstances governing allag\u00e9 (the commission paid to exchange bronze coinage for silver, or silver coinage for gold).

They touch on some of the same themes as the above studies of monetization but rarely allude to coinage per se except as it is reflected in the rates of the salt tax (which applied to animals as well as to people). Complexity is a characteristic of Ptolemaic rule, resulting from particular adaptations of ancient institutions, such as the imposition of tax farming upon the existing system of tax collection by royal officials. Egyptian scribes continued to work in record keeping, but this was now a bilingual operation at the lower levels of the hierarchy, and the scribes had to add the Greek terminology of drachms and obols to the Egyptian terminology of deben and kite. The latter, the authors note, was not well suited to recording the small amounts of cash involved in salt tax levies. The salt tax, the obol tax, and other cash taxes were pervasive but modest, suggesting a symbolic importance at least as great as their economic importance. The rates were repeatedly lowered, a development that may reflect some difficulties in collection but also attests to the concern of the rulers for the welfare of their subjects and their land. In addition various occupations and groups were exempt from these taxes, and the earliest exemptions\u2014of teachers, athletic coaches, Dionysiac artists, victors in the national games\u2014illustrate official Ptolemaic support for Greek culture. These and other exemptions highlight the privileged position enjoyed by the immigrant population and by those natives who assisted in the royal administration. Census registers confirm privileged status of immigrants vis-\u00e0-vis Egyptians, evident in their larger households, slave holding, and ownership of cattle and sheep. It was newcomers who invested in lucrative new sectors such as livestock, vineyards, orchards, and olive groves; these were cash products sold mainly in Alexandria, and subject to money taxes, so that they contributed to the process of monetization. Another feature of Ptolemaic rule was the omnipresence of police, for whom pay figures are provided, and various kinds of armed guards.

The prevalence of borrowing is proof of the deleterious impact of the monetary economy, new tax structures, and Greek capitalism on native Egyptians, many of whom were destitute and unable to amass even the small sums of cash required for the payment of taxes.

In Egypt under the reign of Darius II, numerous documents attest to the equivalence of the silver deben (c. 91g) and the Attic-weight gold stater, itself equivalent to 20 silver drachms or 87.5g of silver. In the Ptolemaic period the chrysous is rarely mentioned as the equivalent of 20 silver drachms except in a particular type of demotic marriage contract involving a (probably fictive) payment from bride to groom of deben of silver from the treasury of Ptah, and translated in Greek registers as syngraphe trophitis argyriou chryson drachmon\u2014evidence that the term chrysous could be used to refer to silver. This ambiguity is relevant to interpreting the term chrysoi in the Greek text of the Pithom Stele (Raphia Decree); Cuvigny concludes that it was used as an accounting term only, reflecting the expenditure of 6 million drachms of unspecified metal. Another question that engages Cuvigny is the name of the quarter mnaiaion: MARESH (Bronze und Silber (Opladen, 1995), p. 108) proposed that this coin was called a chrysous, but Cuvigny rejects the interpretation because the only support for it comes from P. Oxy. XLIX 3455.28\u201329, a theoretical document from the third or fourth century A.D. The nomenclature of gold coinage had an additional role in metrology. The term mnaiaion referred to an actual coin but was also a unit of weight; similarly, the term chrysous was the Greek equivalent for the deben as a unit of weight. In this perspective, the deben, as a unit of weight equivalent to 20 drachms, was perhaps reduced to 72g to conform to the weight of 20 Ptolemaic drachms of 3.27g. The tetarte was an accounting unit only, reckoned as one sixteenth of the mnaiaion and one quarter of the chrysous, but with no corresponding coin.\u21a9#p41\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/2/#p42\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "BURKHALTER AND PICARD [68] review the papyrological evidence for the monetary units employed in different periods of Ptolemaic history, contrasting the bronze drachm of the third century, which could (with the payment of allag\u00e9) be exchanged for a silver drachm at a slight discount, with the bronze drachm of the second and first centuries, which must have been a unit of account rather than an actual coin, since prices for this period are given in minae and talents.

Elsewhere, DAVESNE [79] also suggests that the well-attested spate of countermarking of Ptolemaic issues by the city of Byzantium is the result of the subvention of Philadelphus to the city known from Dion. Byz. 41 and that this occurred during the same war (the generally acccepted date of 280/79 for this episode would rule out such a connection, however: see BRINGMANN, VON STEUBEN [6], p. 271). In fact, a more systematic treatment of the evidence by NOESKE [18] reveals that a sequence of 10 countermarks was used, the earliest appearing on a Ptolemaic issue of 280, the latest on an issue of 246. Noeske notes that the first example of the countermark may be connected with Demetrius\u2019 testimonium, but suggests that Ptolemaic aid must have been ongoing. However, it may well be questioned whether the countermarks have anything to do with Ptolemaic benefactions at all. In general, DAVESNE [79] finds no particular links between the other Syrian Wars fought by Philadelphus (the hypothesised conflict of 281\u201379 BC, and so-called First Syrian War of 274\u20131) and reform of or unusual activity at the Ptolemaic mints.

Under Ptolemy I (c. 310\u2013300) two denominations were produced (20\u201322mm, 9g; 16\u201317mm, 5g). Subsequently (c. 300 onwards) these two denominations were maintained (the larger with a change of type) and supplemented by one smaller module (11mm, 2g) and two larger (26\u201328mm, 18g; 32\u201335mm, 28g). Under Philadelphus mints opened for this coinage on Cyprus. The authors speculate as to which of the earlier two denominations (9g or 4.5g) was the chalkous, and thus as to the nature of the other denominations, and the ratio of bronze to silver values. In a subsequent study DAVESNE [76] argues instead that the smallest denomination, now described as weighing c. 1g is to be seen as the chalkous. If, as PICARD [107] suggests, there is a continuity between the bronze systems of Ptolemy I and the reformed system of Ptolemy II, the ascertainment of the ideal weight of the chalkous at the earlier period is of particular interest. For example, if this was in the order of 1.5g (so PICARD, [107].), then a drachma of bronze on the same standard would have had an ideal theoretical weight of c. 72g. Since this now appears to have been the weight of the the principal bronze denomination after Philadelphus\u2019 reform of the coinage in the 260s (see below), then such a conclusion has clear implications for the nature of Philadelphus\u2019 reform. It would be come one of denomination, not of standard. As PICARD [106], elsewhere notes, if the bronze of the Ptolemies is simply to be viewed as a replacement for silver fractions no longer being struck, then their policy has parallels elsewhere in the Greek world at the same time.

Instead the largest, and standard, bronze coin under Philadelphus was, for most of the time, her module B (c. 40mm; 72g). This was replaced, she suggests, for a brief period at the beginning of Euergetes\u2019 reign with module A, before module B again became the standard denomination in the later reign of Euergetes and the beginning of that of Philopator.

Her Egyptian coins depict her with the horn of Ammon, reflecting her epithet \u201cdaughter of Ammon.\u201d Of particular interest is the complex symbolism of the pomegranates in the dikeras, which evoke love, marriage, fertility, and life after death and thus associate the deified queen with Hera, Aphrodite, Persephone, and Isis. VON REDEN [149] sees the fruits in the dikeras as Dionysiac. She recalls an Egyptian myth that Zeus fathered Dionysus on Amaltheia (source of the horn) and then named the place of their lovemaking, a fertile region shaped like a bull\u2019s horn, Amaltheias keras.

The gold staters of Agathocles, which imitate silver tetradrachms of his father-in-law Ptolemy, must portray Alexander rather than a personification of Africa, and later Ptolemaic bronze coins with the elephant headdress may also be ruler portraits.  MASTROCINQUE [149] recalls the myth of the infant Zeus nurtured by the goat Amaltheia, submits that this creates a link between Zeus and the cornucopiae, and suggests that Ptolemaic coins associating the eagle with either a cornucopiae or a shield could allude to the early Ptolemaic court myth that the infant Ptolemy was exposed on a shield and nourished by an eagle sent by Zeus. MEYBOOM [150] forges a chain of equivalences involving the benu bird, the phoenix, and Osiris to support a theory that the eagle on Ptolemaic coins symbolizes the king as Lord of the Flood and thus the source of Egypt\u2019s prosperity and well being. This significance is especially clear, he alleges, when the eagle is accompanied by a cornucopiae or lotus bud symbol. The prominent association of cornucopiae and eagle on tetradrachms and bronze coins of Ptolemy III may lend a kind of support to Meyboom\u2019s idea that the eagle might allude to the phoenix that appeared at Heliopolis in 238, announcing the beginning of a new Sothis cycle. This connection cannot be valid in general, however, because the Ptolemaic eagle was introduced to the coinage during the satrapy of Ptolemy I, some eighty years before the appearance of the phoenix. Similarly the significance attributed to the lotus blossom is a little suspect, as it is now recognized as a mintmark of Cyprus (LORBER, \u201cThe Lotus of Aphrodite on Ptolemaic Bronzes,\u201d SNR 80 (2001), pp. 39\u201352).

LARONDE [146] identifies a portrait head of Ptolemy III from Apollonia in Cyrenaica, citing that king\u2019s bronze portrait coins and the tetradrachm Svoronos 996 from the Sophikon hoard. This identification must be treated with caution because of the perfunctory artistic quality of the bronze coins cited and especially because the Sophikon tetradrachm may well represent Ptolemy II rather than Ptolemy III, based on its iconographic similarity to the Tarsian tetradrachms reattributed from Euergetes to Philadelphus by DAVESNE (\u201cLa Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre de Syrie (ca. 261\u2013255 avant J.C.) et les t\u00e9moignages numismatiques,\u201d in M.

PALAGIA [153] identifies a marble head with wings in the Sparta Museum as a portrait of Ptolemy III assimilated to Hermes. As supporting evidence she mentions, inter alia, bronze coins of Abdera that may portray the winged head of a Ptolemy and second-century bronze coins of Marathus allegedly showing Ptolemy III with a caduceus over his shoulder. That the Abderite coins portray a Ptolemy has been questioned most recently by CHRYSSANTHAKI [217], who asserts that Abdera lay outside the area of Ptolemaic control, identifies the winged head as Perseus, and dates the coins to the time of Philip V. The evidentiary value of the Marathus bronzes is also dubious. In her monographic study of Aradus and its peraia [266], DUYRAT emphasizes the strong ties of loyalty to the Seleucids despite formal autonomy, and elsewhere she has described the Marathian coin type simply as Hermes (\u201cLes ateliers mon\u00e9taires de Ph\u00e9nicie du Nord \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque hell\u00e9nistique,\u201d in C.

ASHTON [151] briefly mentions the coin portraits of Ptolemy VI in connection with the possibility of shared sources for statues of Ptolemy VI in Egyptian and Greek style. JOHANSEN [141] emphasizes the value of coins as a source for the iconography of Cleopatra VII and contrasts the style of her portraits on denarii and tetradrachms (where Antony is described, wrongly, as occupying the obverse). FERROUKHI [137] uses coins of Cleopatra VII and Cleopatra Selene as comparanda in identifying portraits in the round but submits that sculptural style trumps comparisons with numismatic iconography, concluding that one of the Cherchell heads found at Caesarea, Mauretania, must depict Cleopatra Selene rather than Cleopatra VII.\u21a9#p108\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/2/#p109\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Several studies treat royal titles and coin legends, another aspect of Lagid self-representation.

The ratio provided by Pliny between the cheapest and the most expensive flour is 1 to 2 (NH 18.90). The corresponding price ratio for wheat was certainly closer to 20%, since lower extraction and water retention rates when processing the bread from grain would characterize the flour obtained from the finest wheat: Jasny 1947, 191. Median wine prices enjoyed a significantly wider range due to their sole difference in intrinsic quality: 1 to 4, still excluding the priciest wines (Mrozek 1975, 14 ). Even in Egypt, whose wine did not enjoy much praise, a similar ratio is observed: Rathbone 1997, 224-227.

This said, the gap between the tetradrachms and the denarii has been drastically reduced for the period of Nero by more recent research, essentially by lowering the silver content of the denarii : Butcher and Ponting 2005b. The silver ratio between the tetradrachm and the denarius would have been close to 86.5% instead of 67%. We are not aware of any recent analysis of Commodus\u2019s coinage. This said, Walker\u2019s results as summarized by Duncan-Jones pointed to 2.12 g. of silver, whereas we know that the debasement of Septimius Severus brought the silver content down to around 1.55 g. of silver (Gitler and Ponting 2003, 38, table A). It is therefore unlikely Commodus\u2019s denarii would have been significantly below 2 g. of silver. Walker\u2019s metallic analysis found only 0.85 g. of silver in Egyptian tetradrachms of that period. Since the gaps between more ancient and recent methods in determining silver content usually occur for the richer coinage, it seems quite safe to assume that by Commodus the Egyptian billon coinage contained only about 40 to 45% of the silver included in the Imperial coinage.

The superior planets have orbits outside the Earth\u2019s. Those known in ancient times were Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. All the planets appear from the Earth to orbit nonuniformly, with a periodic alternation of prograde and retrograde motion. Ancient Greek models of planetary motion prior to Ptolemy were based on the idea that these \"anomalistic\" motions could, at least in first approximation, be modelled using a combination of two circular motions\u2014the so-called \u201cdeferent-and-epicycle\u201d and \"eccentre\" models.22 This theory apparently originated in the early second century BC with Apollonios of Perga and his contemporaries, though an earlier date cannot be ruled out.23 Using these ideas, the motions of the inferior planets can be mechanized fairly easily with just two gears\u2014a fixed gear on the central axis and an epicyclic gear that engages with this fixed gear\u2014combined with a pin and slotted follower.24 The superior planets have proved more difficult to model in a way that fits the mechanical constraints of the Mechanism\u2019s design. Our reconstruction proposes mechanisms for the superior planets based on the known mechanization of the lunar anomaly at the back of the Antikythera Mechanism.

We discuss this important model later in 3.5. In Wright's model, the solar anomaly was mechanized as well. In the light of the subsequent discovery of the mechanization of the lunar anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism, we believe that it was very likely that the solar anomaly was also included.\u21a9#p26\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/4/#p27\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "A recent careful study has demonstrated that the graduation of at least one of the two extant front dial rings, the Egyptian calendar ring and the zodiac ring, had a small apparently systematic nonuniformity, which can be explained as a deliberate nonuniform spacing of the degrees on the zodiac ring so that a uniformly revolving mean Sun pointer would simultaneously indicate both the true Sun's longitude and the Egyptian calendar date.27 On this hypothesis, the motion of pointers representing the motions of the Moon and planets would incorporate a solar anomaly component (a not inconceivable notion, though contrary to known ancient theories) unless the pointers revolved around an eccentric axis. An alternative planetary display also explored in that study hypothesizes that there were no pointers for the planets revolving around the zodiac dial, but instead a system of five subsidiary dials with uniformly revolving pointers indicating the planets' synodic cycles. We believe that the inscriptional evidence examined below rules out such subsidiary dials. Moreover, the division of circles into ostensibly equal arcs elsewhere in the Mechanism is sometimes evidently nonuniform, for example in the spacing of teeth on gears,28 the holes for mounting the Egyptian calendar dial,29 and the divisions of the Saros eclipse dial, as we have confirmed from observations of the X-ray CT data. Hence we are not convinced that the Mechanism's designer intentionally represented solar anomaly through nonuniform graduation of the zodiac ring instead of by epicyclic gearwork and we have reconstructed all the pointers as radiating from the central axis.\u21a9#p27\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/4/#p28\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "\u21a9#p28\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/4/#p29\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Fig. 4 The Cosmos on the front of the Antikythera Mechanism. \u00a92011 Tony Freeth, Images First Ltd.

There are mechanical difficulties in creating this image of the planets, since the lunar phase mechanism requires that the solar output is adjacent to the lunar output in the coaxial output system.30 This is because the lunar phase mechanism acts as a differential system to calculate the Moon\u2019s phases from the difference between the lunar and solar rotations. The lunar phase mechanism must therefore have access to the solar rotation. The lunar output is carried by a central axle from the back of the Mechanism and the Sun must therefore be the first tube in the coaxial system. This would naturally place the Sun next to the Moon in the output display, leaving no room for Mercury and Venus between Moon and Sun. However, there is a way round this problem. Our conjectural solution is to retain the pointer system and to mark the pointers with \u201clittle spheres\u201d at different distances along the pointers to indicate their orbits. The solar pointer is marked by a \u201clittle golden sphere\u201d (as mentioned in the Back Cover Inscription, 2.3.2) and the planetary pointers with appropriately coloured spheres for the planets. These spheres are placed at distances, which represent their geocentric orbits in the prevailing ancient Greek order of proximity to the Earth: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In this way the \u201cCosmos\u201d idea is preserved, whilst the lunar phase mechanism has access to the Sun rotation. Rehm's idea to display the planets on concentric rings would not work for exactly this reason. In a coaxial system with outputs as rings, the order of the rings must follow the order of nesting of the coaxial outputs\u2014so the Sun would have to be adjacent to the Moon, which would contradict the standard order of the bodies in the Aristotelian cosmology.

Cicero does not say explicitly that he had seen Posidonios' device, but it is likely enough that he had, and in the worst case his direct connection with Posidonios renders it unlikely that his information is inaccurate. All that he tells us, however, is that Posidonios' mechanism translated a single rotary input into a display of the diverse  motions of the Sun, Moon, and five planets. The description of the mechanism forms part of an a fortiori philosophical argument for the existence of a divine designer of the cosmos: the claim is that the complexity of the mechanism's displays, though far inferior to that of the real heavens, would suffice to convince any viewer that it had been constructed by an intelligent mind.

In the latter work, a dialogue whose dramatic date is 129 BC, one of the interlocutors asserts that he remembers having seen Archimedes' sphaera back in 166 BC; it was made of bronze and it showed the Earth, Moon, and Sun in the correct configurations at the appropriate stages of the lunar month for solar and lunar eclipses\u2014though we are not told whether it actually predicted which conjunctions and oppositions could have eclipses. In any case, Cicero is not likely to have himself seen Archimedes' sphaera, and he may be attributing to it the characteristics of Posidonios' mechanism.

The order is clearly based on the presumed geocentric distances. Thus we infer that the \"circles\" were concentric rings inscribed or imagined within the dial, representing the spherical etherial shells that contained the visible heavenly bodies according to the ancient Greek so-called Aristotelian cosmology. Each pointer, radiating from the centre of the zodiacal dial, as in Wright's reconstruction,46 would have had its little spherical marker representing the planet at a different distance from the common axis, so that the sphere would appear to be in the appropriate shell. Thus when the text speaks of Mars's circle being \"above\" the Sun in line 21, it means \"further out from the centre\" rather than towards the top of the Mechanism.

The plates are parallel and are held in place by a wooden sub-frame and an external box.

The larger gears run close to the plates and are supported by \u201cspacers\u201d, consisting of narrow curved strips of bronze under the perimeters of the gears.48 These appear to be designed to prevent the gears rocking on their axes. In addition, the Main Drive Wheel, b1, is constrained by four clips attached to the Main Plate, which hold the gear parallel to the Main Plate.49 Again, this arrangement would be unlikely in modern practice because of the additional friction involved.

For the planets, the most important set of intervals was the so-called \"Goal-Year\" periods, which were used to forecast repetitions of phenomena such as first and last visibilities and stationary points; these are sub-century intervals approximately comprising whole numbers of solar years and whole numbers of a planet's synodic cycles, so that after one Goal-Year period a planet will repeat its phenomena at very nearly the same longitudes. Besides the Goal-Year periods, many other approximate periods are attested in Babylonian texts, including longer and more accurate periods (of the order of centuries) that were built up out of the shorter ones to serve as the basis for advanced methods of predicting planetary motion.61\u21a9#p220\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/4/#p221\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "For the purposes of forecasting future occurrences of phenomena one-to-one from observed past occurrences, it sufficed to know the duration of a suitable period for the planet in question without having to take account of the planet's behaviour during the period.

There is a precedent in the Antikythera Mechanism for a rotation being carried by a tube in the lunar anomaly mechanism, where the input to the system of the mean sidereal month is carried via a tube through gear e3 to the epicyclic system. For our model of the Antikythera Mechanism, we have outputs for the Moon, Sun, Date, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. In engineering terms, the manufacture of seven coaxial tubes surrounding the lunar output would have been one of the hardest challenges in the whole design. The total width of this tube system is constrained by the fixed input gear for Mars. This is one of the reasons that we have increased the module of the Mars gears, so that the fixed input gear is as large as possible. In our model, its inner radius is 10 mm. We have left a margin of 2.8 mm between the inner radius of the gear and the hole for the output system. Our output tube system has an external radius of 7.0 mm and this passes through a hole in the superior planet input gears of radius 7.2 mm.

A similar system of tubes is used in Wright's model.83 Wright cites the ancient aulos (flute), with its concentric sliding tubes, as evidence that the ancient Greeks had this capability.84 There is no doubt that the Antikythera Mechanism was made in a culture with a very advanced engineering capacity.\u21a9#p455\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/4/#p456\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "As with all the surviving parts of the Mechanism, our proposed model for the planetary mechanisms is designed to be taken apart for calibration and maintenance.

The Antikythera Mechanism shows that Greek gear technology was far in advance of the level we would infer from the written record, having attained mastery of differential gearing (as in the Moon ball apparatus) as well as the translation of uniform into nonuniform rates of motion by means of epicyclic gearing and pin-and-slot couplings.

The Antikythera Mechanism, if we have correctly reconstructed its front display,  turns out to embody all these aspects. Its gearwork invisibly mimicked the kinds of geometrical model whose theoretical validity was among the chief research questions of the time; through its front display it gave a graphic demonstration of how models based on eccentres or epicycles could account for the varying apparent speeds of the Sun and Moon, the limits of Venus' and Mercury's elongation from the Sun, and the retrogradations of all the planets. Babylonian period relations underlay many, if not all, of the gear trains, and the readout of the heavenly bodies' longitudes on a zodiacal ring graduated in degrees was also a fundamentally Babylonian conception.

On the west wall of courtyard (c) a big window looking onto the street (Rue du Stade) was opened in the second phase. This wall, as well as its northern extension towards rooms (g) and (h), were originally built by a combination of mud and stone (in stone up to 1.40-1.60 m and then mud), and due to considerations in the need for load bearing support of the second floor in the second phase of the house they were altered to only stone. The addition in stone that replaced the mud part in the second phase is thinner than the lower part of the wall by 10-15 cm and forms a horizontal irregular line on the wall (fig. 6). Plassart had noted the difference in the thickness of the wall, but did not associate it with the replacement of the mud part with the addition of the second floor.73 This wall formed the west fa\u00e7ade of the house and flanked rooms (g) and (h) as well as courtyard (c). The wall is not interconnected with the north and south walls of rooms (g) and (h) and the addition of the second floor posed problems of stability for the mud part of the wall. A similar decision was taken in the case of room (a).

A comparison with the Maison des Sceaux (GD 59D) in the Quartier de Skardhana (the other newer neighborhood on Delos), whose destruction by fire has preserved evidence for the use of its rooms, is instructive.83 The Maison des Sceaux was also modified in a similar way in a later phase of the house (fig. 7). The east part of the ground floor was separated and small rooms were created to accommodate a store and workshop for grain, wine, and maybe olive oil production, which was accessible almost independently from the main entrance of the house.84 At the west part of the ground floor the traditional oecus maior of the house, room (\u03bc), was connected with room (\u03b9\u0384) of the adjacent Maison de l\u2019Ep\u00e9e, thus extending the area of the house. In the new arangment adjacent rooms (\u03be) and\u00a0 (\u03b9\u0384) were accessible only through room (\u03bc), that was in turn accessible from the courtyard through pastas (\u03b8\u0384). This individual cluster of rooms could have been rented out to a business.85 The large number of pottery and twenty amphoras found in room (\u03bb), to the east of pastas (\u03b8\u0384), as well as the large piece of furniture found along the east wall of its adjacent to the south room (\u03ba) suggest that these two rooms were used as storage spaces.86\u00a0This storage could have served the activities of the adjacent cluster of rooms (\u03bc-\u03be-\u03b9\u0384), of the store and workshop at the east part of the house (\u03c0-\u03c1-\u03c3-\u03c4-\u03c5) or of the inhabitants of the upper floor of the house.

The study of the storage facilities in the old neighborhood of the Theatre (Quartier du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre) has shown that by contrast to the large storage facilities around the port, the storage facilities further up the hill, in the neighborhood of the Theatre, were of smaller scale inside the boutiques and next to manufacturing installations, while some provisions were made inside the houses.105 In both new neighborhoods, the Quartier de Skardhana and the Quartier du Stade, there are no big storage facilities next to the port and the small storage facilities must have been integrated within the urban fabric, inside the residences (e.g., rooms k and l in House ID) as well as next to the manufacturing installations (e.g., perfumery IIB).

We will do the same (and more) in this introduction. The one point that was stressed at LAWDI was stability, particularly of published URIs (and for discussion of the difference between URIs and URLs see Sauerman et al. [2008]). The fundamental practice of giving individual URIs to all discrete resources that a project published was energetically endorsed. Among the types of URIs often used as examples within the study of the ancient world were Pleiades URIs for ancient places (e.g. https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/59672) and the Worldcat catalog stood out as providing common identifiers with impact beyond any single discipline (e.g. http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/768969647). Beyond stability, the faculty and participants at LAWDI both stressed and searched for common vocabularies that can be used to encourage machine readability of the information available at the stable URIs that currently exist and that will become available. The Pelagios Project (Isaksen et al. 2014), which is aggregating disparate uses of Pleiades identifiers, has shown the utility of expressing links between resources in such a way that they can be automatically harvested. Nomisma.org has also made progress in this direction. Putting aside specific examples, the articles published here often express the desire for greater clarity on how to refer to people, places, and events, in addition to such abstract concepts as periods and typologies. That common practice is desirable was a clear outcome of the 2012 LAWDI session (Elliot, Heath and Muccigrosso 2012) and remained a topic of discussion in 2013.\u21a9#p4\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/elliott-heath-muccigrosso/#p5\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Despite an avoidance of excessively technical presentations, LAWDI did not shy away from highlighting the \u201cRDF Triple\u201d as an important tool in ongoing efforts to encourage interoperability.

A type of pottery is discovered in a building. That pottery has an origin and the building has a terminus post quem. All of this can represented as triples. If URIs are used, then those triples can refer to definitions distributed across the Internet. Data starts to be linked and analysis by third-parties is enabled.

It would include a robust controlled vocabulary, with the ability to tag citations with stable identifiers for places and monuments, authors, texts and passages within texts, historical figures, artifacts and works of art, and themes or subjects discussed in the scholarly works included. It would allow more comprehensive identification of bibliographic items on a topic, and would facilitate the automatic feeding of scholarly citations into web sites discussing topics. Imagine, for example, a Pleiades place page (Foss et al. 2013) or an entry for an artifact at Arachne (German Archaeological Institute and University of Cologne 2013) including a feed of bibliographic citations discussing that place/artifact that automatically updated when new articles were added to the comprehensive bibliography.

Library name authorities are now collected at the Virtual International Authority File (OCLC 2013), a collaborative resource which has shown itself open to the addition of new names and formats as scholarly disciplines present the need for them (for example, Syriac scholars: (Smith-Yoshimura and Michelson 2013)). There are several standard numbers for monographs, the most linked open data friendly of which is currently the OCLC number, since the open WorldCat database provides stable URIs for items by OCLC number as well as providing RDFa for many entries. (Wallis 2012) Control numbers for scholarly bibliographic items that are not monographs are less pervasive, but for those journals and other web publishers that have adopted it the DOI is an excellent control number for scholarly articles and other publications. (International DOI Foundation 2013)  For controlled subject vocabularies, the Library of Congress Subject Headings are available as linked open data, (Library of Congress 2013) and the Getty Center has recently announced a plan to open access to its controlled vocabularies for art and archaeology.

My first recommendation is to expose bibliographic citations on the open web, ideally in a format that is friendly towards linked data, if you are developing a scholarly internet-based project or publication. Zotero, which allows the export of citations in BIBO format, is already widely used in the humanities in American academia. (Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media 2013) The Ancient World Open Bibliographies project (Acheson 2013) has been collecting open-access bibliographies in Zotero since October 2010, and increasingly scholars are creating these bibliographies within Zotero in the first place. Zotero can also serve as a storage location for a bibliography that is presented as an inherent part of a digital project: the online bibliography on Evagrius Ponticus by Joel Kalvesmaki of Dumbarton Oaks is an excellent model to follow.(Kalvesmaki 2013) Scholars can also include links to the stable URIs for people, monographs, or journal articles if they are posting bibliographic citations in web environments; I wrote some recommendations for good linking practices for bibliographic citations in a blog post shortly after LAWDI 2012.(Acheson 2012a)\u21a9#p5\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/acheson/#p6\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "A linked open bibliographic citation database for ancient studies would benefit scholars (and their students) directly, especially those at smaller or less wealthy institutions which do not subscribe to indexes, but it would also serve as a form of outreach to the broader public.

A linked open bibliographic database as proposed here could provide a bridge between popular (and undergraduate level) discussions of topics on the web and the more formal publications of the academic world.

It was during the production of the wall maps that limitations to the AWMC's previous approach of primarily viewing maps as flat images became readily apparent. The sheer scale of the project, coupled with the myriad changes suggested by reviewers, revealed the necessity of an easily reproducible, readily searchable, and scalable system  to display and sort the over 200,000 individual objects residing in the center's database. As an outgrowth of this realization, the AWMC began an initiative to create an end-user  customizable web application to generate maps and replace the older static images provided by the center.

The alignment of the center's resources with Pleiades IDs for all features, along with adding custom metadata where appropriate, became the foundation for the center's movement towards these goals.

Recent archaeology extensions of the CIDOC-CRM, led by English Heritage (Tudhope et al. 2011), also represent important informatics contributions.\u21a9#p12\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/kansa/#p13\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "However, to paraphrase a famous meme, \u201cone does not simply map to the CRM.\u201d The CIDOC-CRM\u2019s sophistication also makes it difficult to use in practice. For example, we recently had a discussion with a librarian trying to use the CIDOC-CRM to organize some archaeological data from a survey for publication in Open Context. The librarian used the CIDOC-CRM property \u201cP3 has_note\u201d as a predicate for use with Munsell color readings of potsherds. This raised some interesting issues. It is probably debatable if a Munsell color reading is simply a descriptive \u201cnote\u201d or if a Munsell color reading is more of a measurement. If the latter, then the CIDOC-CRM property \u201cP43F has_dimension\u201d would probably be a more appropriate predicate. In theory, Munsell can be seen as an objective measurement. In practice, many researchers take Munsell readings because they vaguely think they should, and then they do not adequately control for all sorts of issues (lighting conditions, dampness, color blindness, etc.) that may impact a Munsell reading. The example above illustrate how difficult the CIDOC-CRM can be to use in practice. The CIDOC-CRM contains many conceptual nuances that can lead to different potential mappings. In addition, mapping to the CIDOC-CRM, or any other vocabulary or ontology for that matter, carries with it interpretive decisions. One has to make a judgement call if a Munsell reading measures a dimension or if it is simply a note. Finally, in many cases, one may not have sufficient information about a dataset to make these judgement calls. Sebastian Heath (https://github.com/lawdi/LAWD/issues/3#issuecomment-18934276) raised similar issues with respect to modeling archaeological contexts, especially from legacy excavations where the tacit knowledge behind excavation documentation may be lost.\u21a9#p13\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/kansa/#p14\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "These issues would be easier to navigate if one could refer to established practice, and look at other examples of the CIDOC-CRM in use as a guide. However, despite the prominence of the CIDOC-CRM, it is surprisingly hard to find actual CIDOC-CRM organized datasets to use as examples, at least in archaeology. More real-world implementations of the CIDOC-CRM would provide invaluable guidance. Part of the value of referencing Pleiades comes from Pelagios (see Simon et al. 2012), a system that aggregates Pleiades annotations. The services provided by Pelagios make investing in Pleiades annotations worthwhile. Unfortunately, the CIDOC-CRM has no clear analog to Pelagios. We currently need to wait for mandarins of the CIDOC-CRM to review our mappings in order to get feedback, and even if this happens, our efforts would seem only relevant and noticed by a narrow audience of CIDOC-CRM aficionados. Systems that aggregate CIDOC-CRM content would be ideal, since such systems could help provide feedback about which mappings make sense and which do not. Without implementations that give such feedback, our experiments with mapping Open Context data to the CIDOC-CRM will go untested and mainly have theoretical value. In other words, right now, Open Context\u2019s mappings to the CIDOC-CRM feel a little bit like eating spinach: in theory, it is good for us, but in practice, it is hard to identify its tangible benefits.\u21a9#p14\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/kansa/#p15\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Our struggles with the CIDOC-CRM illustrate some of the tensions behind different visions of \u201cLinked Data\u201d and the \u201cSemantic Web.\u201d In my view, the CIDOC-CRM represents an approach that seems very much at home with the Semantic Web. I see the Semantic Web as much more of a totalizing vision that emphasizes ontology and schema alignment between datasets across the Web. By reference to common conceptual models, the Semantic Web could enable powerful inference capabilities that draw upon logical relationships between data and ontologies. The problem with this vision is that non-trivial ontologies like the CIDOC-CRM can be hard to use in practice. They can be also be used inconsistently (as illustrated with the example about Munsell values above). Beyond these practical problems, the research community has yet to really grapple with the theoretical implications of ontology standards. Is the CIDOC-CRM really universally appropriate for all cultural heritage data? Should there be room for alternative ontologies that reflect different research priorities and assumptions?

This project benefited from head-starts in two areas. First the resource for the creation of necessary URIs existed in the nomisma.org project; and second, the collection database of the ANS (http://numismatics.org/search/) already contained the descriptive elements of approximately one third of the c. 50,000 known types of Imperial Coinage.

Since we have used nomisma.org identifiers within CHRR, it has been possible both to enrich the CHRR database with type descriptions from OCRE (see eg.

The most efficient method for maintaining the relationships between coin types in OCRE and their associated coins and hoards is with the use of an RDF database and SPARQL endpoint.

In other cases, OCRE interacts with REST APIs offered by nomisma (simple web service interfaces which conduct more complicated SPARQL queries in the background). The second, SPARQL-aware version of OCRE was released in October 2013.6 The RDF requires three components of data: first, RDF representations of coin types, second RDF descriptions of physical coins or coin hoards, and finally, the RDF data from nomisma.org, which enables links to be made from typological attributes (e.g., http://nomisma.org/id/ar for silver coins or http://nomisma.org/id/augustus for those of Augustus) between types and coins/hoards. The RDF model conforms to the numismatic ontology established by nomisma. It is relatively simple, especially compared with CIDOC-CRM, and lowers the barrier for participation in OCRE. To date, Berlin, the Fralin Museum at the University of Virginia, and CHRR have joined the ANS in contributing data into OCRE.\u21a9#p17\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/meadows-gruber/#p18\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "We can see the relationship between \u2018ideal\u2019 type description and individual specimen more clearly by looking at an example.

Practically speaking, how does this affect OCRE? Rather than updating records in OCRE when the collections of new partners become available, the RDF database stands apart, and thus it is easier to update Fuseki with new collections and manage changes or deletions in collections already contained in the system. Using SPARQL, OCRE (through the Numishare application code) can query Fuseki to display images of coins associated with particular types in record or search results pages. SPARQL query results can be serialized into KML directly and displayed in maps, making it possible to make use of findspots from online coin hoard catalogs (Fig. 7). Using mathematic functions inherent to SPARQL, average weights of coin types or specific typologies (e.g., denarii of Augustus) can be delivered to OCRE directly and rendered in the form of charts and graphs (Fig. 8a) by the Javascript library, Highcharts, which is capable of interpreting this data into HTML5 graphics.

Since the beginning of archaeology, there has been interest in burials and funerary monuments with the hope of interpreting these different responses to death (Parker Pearson 1999). As theory, method and technology have developed through time, our interpretations of mortuary sites have been able to create more nuanced interpretations of why particular societies respond to death in specific manners (Rakita and Buikstra 2005). The physical remains of the dead, the burial context, and the funerary rites they received can reveal much about the lifestyles of the people in the past. However, all of this interpretation relies on the presence of one type of evidence: primary data. Linked open data (LOD) provides a much needed approach for archaeological studies of the deceased, as it would increase sharing of data, improve links between archaeologists, and further study within the discipline at an increased rate.

Across the period of Roman occupation, burial practices varied based on a number of factors including region, citizen status, social rank, family beliefs, and religious cult affiliation. At the beginning of the empire, cremation was the most popular form of burial, with inhumation a secondary option. By the mid-2nd century, the frequencies between the two forms had reversed, and by the 4th century cremation was a rare practice (Nock 1932). Due to imperial tolerance, burial type was not state-mandated and the only stipulation was that the burial itself must take place outside the walls of the city. However, the types of tombs, the funerary rites, and the choice to cremate or inhume was left to the mourning community. This meant there was great diversity in the types of burials found throughout the empire, despite the strong Roman cultural influence (Toynbee 1996). The extent of adoption of the Roman identity in their various territories meant that burial practices were interpreted in a variety of ways, with some provinces changing with Roman invasion, some forms of hybrid mortuary programs and others maintaining their ancestral ways (Webster 2001).\u21a9#p2\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/meyers/#p3\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "The questions that stem from a brief overview of Roman Imperial burials are what were the different mortuary practices and how did Roman influence change, influence, or be rejected by different social groups across the provinces?

The data required to answer this question is immense and expansive- but it does exist. Excavations have been done of Roman Imperial and Roman Provincial sites from around the Mediterranean, Europe and Britain (Keegan 2002, Killgrove 2005, Morris 1992, Murali and Girard 2000, Philpott 1991, Wahl 2008, Williams 2004).\u21a9#p3\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/meyers/#p4\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "There are two primary problems that prevent synthesis: there is no standard method for classifying cemeteries that would allow for direct comparison of the mortuary sites, and this data is rarely found in accessible formats digitally or in print.

Once we better understand these authentic rams, we might then use them to explain differences in ram iconography in sculpture, on coins and seals, and in paintings, graffiti and mosaics.

The sockets can still be seen at Nikopolis in western Greece on a Victory Monument built by Augustus to commemorate his defeat of Antony and Cleopatra in a great naval battle fought nearby. The rams were large, if we may judge from their sockets, whose details allow for the recovery of the rams shapes.

The aim of this research project is to assess the suitability of existing tools for the representation of the ambiguous, incomplete and at times unknown literary narratives that play out within the content of compositions written in the ancient language of Sumerian, and published by the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (henceforth ETCSL)3, an online resource from the University of Oxford, which allows the public free and unlimited access to the lemmatised transliteration and English translation of some 400 composite texts.\u21a9#p2\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/nurmikko-fuller/#p3\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "This research project began with an extensive review, and led to the identification and subsequent evaluation of two OWL ontologies thought to be suitable for the representation of cultural heritage data and narrative structures: the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM)4 and Ontomedia (OM)5. The decision to include the CIDOC CRM was two-fold. Firstly, this event-based reference model is specifically designed as the \u201csemantic glue\u201d6 for linking cross-domain cultural heritage data, and has been implemented by institutions with large cuneiform collections, such as the British Museum.7 Although the ETCSL carries little object data directly, the print, electronic and cuneiform sources for each composite text are listed with each transliteration and serve as potential anchoring points for clusters of RDF triples that would allow the enrichment of the ETCSL data from other sources within Assyriology and the wider Digital Heritage community. Secondly, OM, the second ontology and one designed for the representation of narrative, was purposely designed to link to the CIDOC CRM (Lawrence 2008). Unlike the CIDOC CRM which is one large, all-encompassing structure, OM consists of several interlinking sub-ontologies, amongst which the user-consumer can opt to pick and choose any that bear relevance to their data. OM is essentially an domain-specific upper-level ontology : this oxymoron can be justified if one agrees that the ontological representation of narratives is itself a niche topic but that since OM seeks to be applicable to all fictional narratives (regardless of sub-genre), it  can be seen as an example of the class of upper-level ontologies.\u21a9#p3\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/nurmikko-fuller/#p4\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "The combination of the CIDOC CRM and OM and the addition of a number of specific elements deemed necessary resulted in the creation of mORSuL (the multi-Ontology Representing Sumerian Literature).

They agree to all to go together, and in their absence, the ox mounts the cow, the cow gives birth to a calf and the calf eats the load on the wagon. Who, they ask the king, does the calf belong to?

Firstly, although the events depicted are fictional, the story is set in, or at least refers to, the historical city of Adab (modern Bismaya). The natural laws that govern our reality are applicable to the main ome:Context too (the \u201creality\u201d in which the story takes place) and at no point is the reader required to suspend their disbelief or encounter entities or events that are magical, supernatural or within a dream. The events as told by the ox-drivers may appear farcical, but are not beyond the remit of plausible realism.

The representation of the ox-drivers\u2019 decision to seek justice is however more complex as is the decision whether to treat it as an instance pertaining to a ome:Social subclass of Legal. It is also worth noting that from the perspective of each ox-driver, they are (presumably) each seeking a decision favourable to themselves and not one which is truly fair. Furthermore, the only account of the events that form the main part of the narrative are the focalised memories of the ox-drivers, and the subsequent retelling of these events by the king, who did not witness them first hand.

Universally familiar, its excavation and scholarship prove a nightmare of omissions and disasters. Each generation discovers with horror the extent to which information has been ignored, neglected, destroyed and left unreported and unpublished\u201d (Wallace-Hadrill 1994, 65). When Andrew Wallace-Hadrill published these words in 1994, they were merely the most succinct and cogent expression of what every scholar already knew: working within the ruins of the ancient city is significantly easier than digging through the equally vast and uneven archive of scholarship. Even what has been published is spread across the world in hundreds of libraries and archives, hidden in obscure and defunct journals, travel diaries, monographs and illustrations. Paradoxically, with the efficiency of interlibrary loan services and electronic means of transmission, it is easier to acquire the actual publication than it is to first discover that source as a relevant citation. Fortunately, in 1998 Laurentino Garcia y Garcia published his landmark compendium of 14,596 annotated citations, the Nova Bibliotheca Pompeiana (NBP), bringing these far-flung titles together for the first time. The arrival of the NBP has not, however, revolutionized the study of Pompeii as expected.

The Pompeii Bibliography and Mapping Resource (PBMR) is a web-based research tool composed of three parts: 1. Bibliographic Database and Full-Text Document Repository, 2. Geographical Information System (GIS) and 3. User Interface. Because Pompeii lacks both a single, searchable bibliography and a standard, up-to-date map, the creation of a resource that solves these problems and simultaneously offers new and powerful search methods will revolutionize research on the ancient city. More specifically, the addition of the Geographical Information System introduces the ability to easily broaden a bibliographic investigation to an adjacent building or related subject without apprehension of investing dozens of hours in new bibliographic searches. One simply moves the mouse and clicks. We believe this will encourage the exploration of imaginative new connections between central and tangential datasets, between what the user was looking for and what interesting side road she was tempted to go down. The GIS will also bring uniquely powerful search tools \u2013 spatial analysis tools, such as proximity, density, and distribution analyses \u2013 that will allow the user to begin or to refine their research based on the landscape of the city. Additionally, because the geographical files will also be available for download, individuals can conduct more advanced analyses and produce new interpretations of Pompeii without each bearing the prohibitive burden of digitizing the entire ancient city.

Academics will gain the ability to quickly conduct exhaustive searches on multiple subjects, simultaneously producing both a series of comprehensive bibliographies for each location and maps illustrating their spatial relationships in the landscape of Pompeii.

To illustrate this point, imagine the results of a multilingual search for \u201cHouse / Casa / Haus / Maison\u201d in the PBMR: hundreds of citations will appear along with hundreds locations highlighted in the map. Of course, these results are practically impossible to use. The spatial analysis tools, however, will permit a user to filter these results by the area each house occupied. Thus, a spatial query for houses between 100m2 and 400m2 will limit the results to only \u2018average\u2019 sized houses. These results can then be further refined by bibliographic criteria, such as year of publication, to find the houses investigated in the last twenty years. Finally, the user might once again choose a spatial characteristic to get at a still more nuanced picture of these houses. For example, she can search the refined results for those houses that \u2018touch the boundary of\u2019 or \u2018contain\u2019 a shop or workshop.

For example, other large, densely occupied archaeological sites such as Teotihuacan in Mexico or Angkor Wat in Cambodia could benefit from this system. Broader geographies are certainly possible as well, such as historical mapping of the bibliography of the crusades. Moreover, more disparate fields, such as English or other modern languages might map the literary landscapes of important genres: naturalists of the Romantic period, Victorian era London, or the diffusion and impact of early Buddhist texts.

The use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for people, places, and things sidesteps the barriers to discovery created by the use of different metadata schemata, different vocabularies, or different languages.

As concepts of convenience, often invented by a single scholar in a seminal work but then modified and debated over long periods of time, deliberately left vague in temporal terms in order to protect their usefulness for relative chronologies, individual periods have no objective existence. Yet they are deeply entangled with both physical space and absolute time, the latter measured by concrete calendar systems and ultimately by the physical rotation of the earth and its movement around the sun. Particular period terms are associated with particular absolute dates in particular places; in turn, changes in the identity of a place at a particular geographic location can only be described in terms of the passage of time, often in the form of historical periodization.\u21a9#p3\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/rabinowitz/#p4\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "The creation of an agreed-upon controlled vocabulary for periods therefore requires either highly local definitions or definitions that are so broad and vague as to be all-encompassing.

It also offers a facet for the European Iron Age, which has several stylistic-chronological subgroups: here, the only value associated with Britain is the La T\u00e8ne period/culture, which is placed in space in \"Northern Europe and the British isles\" and in time from \"the mid-fifth century BCE\" to the \"mid-first century BCE\". Though this definition and that of the UK heritage community overlap partially in time, space and concept, they employ different terms; conversely, a single period term such as \"Iron Age\" can change dramatically in meaning according to where it is used, or by whom. For Linked Data purposes, then, this is not a simple question of using URIs from a shared gazetteer to align different terms for the same period concept.

Using a generic periodization meant, in some cases, that sites would be represented with periods that were not used to describe them in the literature. In other cases, it meant a conflict between the date-range of a period to be represented in the timeline and the history of a particular site. Pompeii is a good example: though Pompeii exists during the more general \"Flavian period\", that site ends abruptly in AD 79, in the middle of that period, with the eruption of Vesuvius. The idiosyncrasies of particular regions and sites therefore led us to a data-model in which the basic unit was the \"site period\", in most cases a local manifestation, with a site-specific date range, of a more general period concept (Figure 2).\u21a9#p6\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/7/rabinowitz/#p7\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Because GeoDia, as a synchronized mashup of a map and a timeline, relies on places with geographic coordinates, it was relatively easy to join the Linked Ancient World Data ecosystem, at least peripherally, by attaching Pleiades URIs to its sites.

We could consume URIs, but we couldn't produce them.

Github will also provide the user-management tools to begin to build a community of contributors to the gazetteer: if an authoritative user cannot find a URI for a period definition she prefers, she will be able to add her own. In the first phase of the project, we will create a visualization interface that makes it easier to find periods, see their spatial or temporal extent and the degree of precision of the latter, and compare different temporal definitions for the same period terms or the temporal overlap between different terms.

With places, we generally tend to agree about the location of those that are well-known, and we generally seek to establish consensus on the location of those that are ambiguous. With periods, although we refer to them in a general way to communicate with each other, we prefer to use precise but idiosyncratic definitions that best fit our own material. We are also careful to cite the sources of those precise definitions, if we did not invent them ourselves: specificity about such matters is a basic tenet of scholarly communication. It seems reasonable, then, to attempt to mirror scholarly practice in the description of periods as Linked Data. The gazetteer PeriodO proposes to create would make room for the disagreement, imprecision, and multivocality that characterizes scholarly discourse, even while providing URIs for structured assertions about periods that include spatiotemporal coordinates and authority citations. This approach will not solve all the problems that face the implementation of period concepts in the Linked Ancient World Data ecosystem, but it does offer a grassroots starting point from which we can begin to explore possibilities. The success of this effort, like the success of Linked Ancient World Data initiatives in general, will depend on the development of a scholarly community of practice, with members willing to implement period assertion URIs in their own datasets and to contribute new period assertions to a gazetteer.

The extant portion of the text on the verso contains the monetary evaluation of three-quarters of the South Indian cargo loaded on the ship Hermapollon (probably at Muziris, mentioned in the text on the recto), and two recent papers, one by Federico Morelli and the other by me, have proposed an almost complete reconstruction of the evaluated commodities. Both papers emphasized, albeit in very different measures, the predominant share of pepper and malabathron in the cargo, the two main exports from the Limyrike emporia.2 Both Morelli and I came to recognize that the 771 money talents and 4,632 drachmae recorded at col. i, ll. 25-263 are the value of (almost) three-quarters of the pepper cargo, but while Morelli suggests that that value resulted from a price of 24 drachmae per mina, I contend that a price of 6 drachmae per mina is the only price that can account for the position of other numerical values in the text. Moreover, both Morelli and I interpret the weight number at col. i, l. 18 as the weight of three-quarters of the malabathron cargo, but while he reads the first two digits as 1,200 and assumes a price of 20 drachmae per mina, I read them as 1,800 and deduce a price of 12 drachmae per mina. Finally, I assume that the Hermapollon\u2019s cargo included another commodity, evaluated at col. i, ll. 14-16, which might have been tortoise shell. In this paper I would like to focus on two other commodities exported on the Hermapollon: the \u201csound\u201d ivory tusks and the schidai. As the meaning of the Greek term schidai in the papyrus is disputed, it makes better sense to analyze the two commodities in reverse order of their appearance in the document.

In that portion of the text\u2014col. ii, ll. 16-25\u2014the value of three-quarters of the schidai brought back by the Hermapollon is calculated.

As a matter of fact, 167 tusks weighing 105 talents and 13 minae (= 3,228.5 kgs) have a rather high average weight of 37.8 minae (= 19.332 kgs) per tusk.74 It is not that great a stretch from the average weight of the two tusks sold to Apollo\u2019s temple in Delos by Herakleides of Tyre (46.3125 minae per tusk)75 or the thirty-four tusks donated by Ptolemy Auletes to the temple of Didyma (42.94 minae per tusk),76 especially since the talent(s) implied by these inscriptions must have been lighter than the one used by the quarter-tax administration to weigh the Hermapollon\u2019s cargo.77\u21a9#p34\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/8/#p35\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "However, those few tusks bought by or donated to a temple were likely of exceptional quality.

In this \u201cvery last emporium of Azania,\u201d a great amount of ivory is said to be available. Its quality, however, was held to be inferior to that exported from the much closer Adulis.88 The composition of the sixteenth-century ivory lots from Sofala suggests that the Rhapta export was inferior to the Adulis one, not because it was from a different species or because their tusks were always less sound than the Adulis ones, but because it resulted from a different kind of trade and perhaps a differently motivated hunt. The fine Adulis ivory came from faraway regions \u201cbeyond the Nile,\u201d it was conveyed to Axum, then to Koloe and finally to Adulis.89 On its way to the Red Sea, the ivory was traded by foreign merchants, who wanted to be paid in Roman money;90 it was shipped to Egypt by merchants from Roman Egypt. Such a commercial circuit necessarily required a deliberate selection of tusks based on their quality, which had to be of the \u201cAdulis standard.\u201d91\u21a9#p37\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/8/#p38\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "In contrast, the Rhapta trade had a completely different style.

The Greek perception of the particular human-elephant relationship in East Africa is reflected in the term Elephantophagoi96 (\u201cElephant-eaters\u201d), elaborated when the exploration of the African world south of Egypt inspired an ethnological taxonomy based on dietary habits. Along the lines of the much older Ichthyophagoi and of the new entry Chelonophagoi (re)discovered in Carmania by Alexander\u2019s army,97 Rhizophagoi, Hylophagoi, Spermatophagoi, Akridophagoi, Struthophagoi, Agriophagoi, Moschophagoi, and Elephantophagoi were identified. Greek ethnographic accounts ignored the fact that elephant meat was to some extent eaten in ancient South India as well. Moreover, the Greek writings did not take into account the idea that African societies may have killed elephants not only for their meat but also to prevent them from crop raiding: in their opinion, fondness for elephant meat was the key factor. In a story repeated by Agatharchides, the Elephantophagoi refused to stop killing elephants and eating their meat despite Ptolemy\u2019s urging and the promise of splendid rewards.98 They replied that they would not change their way of life, not even for all the kingdom of Egypt. The task of providing the Ptolemaic army with an Indian-style elephant division99 thus had to accommodate the cultural traditions of Africa. The story may be fictional, but the perception that in Africa the human-elephant relations were different from India was accurate: the contrast between the African ivory carried by the Portuguese ships and the Indian ivory shipped out by the Hermapollon supports this distinction.\u21a9#p39\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/8/#footnote-asterix\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "* I wish to thank the following friends and colleagues who supported this research in many different ways: Shinu Abraham, Sundeep Abraham, N.

The local landscape has undergone several drastic changes during this long period of time, from a wet to a hyper-arid environment.

Two methods have been followed in the geophysical survey,4 magnetometry and electrical resistivity, but they did not produce the expected results because the difference in the magnetic fields of the materials used in the buildings and the sand that covers them is too small. However, it was possible to establish the presence of buildings buried by sand and debris in different areas, and of some highly magnetic zones. These can be interpreted mainly as ovens or fireplaces in domestic buildings, but two strong positive peaks suggested the presence of anomalous materials. One of these is located in Area 1 of the geophysical survey, which is located inside the temenos (Fig. 3, Fig. 4), west of building ST 20 under excavation. The anomaly revealed the presence at a shallow depth (calculated between 50 and 80 cm) of an \u201cobject\u201d about 1 meter long, south of the standing walls of a building (labelled ST 21) built with local stone and mud brick and with the same technique as the Ptolemaic temple ST 18. Our first hypothesis for the interpretation of the magnetic anomaly was the presence of a basalt statue, which would have been a common occurrence in a temple area. It was then decided to open a new sector in building ST 21 to verify this supposition. In fact, the finding of a statue in context would have probably shed new light on those found in the past and of which the place of discovery is still unknown.

With its 773 mm long blade it can be classified as a long sword. At least this is what an analysis of preserved sword blades of the Roman Principate suggests, according to which the transition between short swords (gladii) and long swords (spathae) is to be estimated at a blade length (without the tang) between 550 and 600 mm.14 To what extent this statement can be transferred to the swords of the Roman Republic is, however, the subject of controversy.15 This is due particularly to a group of blades that was identified by the majority of scholars in the past two decades16 as belonging to the type described in ancient literature as the gladius hispaniensis.17 According to a text, the authorship of which is assigned to Polybius (ca. 200\u2013120 BC),18 the Roman army adopted the gladius hispaniensis at the end of the third century BC from Celtiberians and apparently adapted the foreign weapon to their own technical abilities or ideas of forms as they existed already at this date.

Unfortunately, there are so far no unequivocal indications from \u201cpure\u201d Roman contexts that might permit an absolutely certain archaeological identification of this standard weapon of the Roman army in late Republican times. In any case, the body of Republican militaria, for which the use by regular Roman soldiers can certainly be proven, is minimal. Thus, those blades, which are favored by scholars as evidence for the gladius hispaniensis (e.g., Fig. 14.1\u20132, Fig. 15), of which the waisted blade shape after all shows a strong relation to early Roman Imperial short swords of the Mainz type,19 are in their large majority from sites in contact areas between the Roman sphere of influence and the late Iron Age societies of Central and western Europe.20 In these areas, Italo-Roman imported goods were frequent components of representative behavior of higher social classes.21 Nevertheless some of the mentioned societies had independent, highly evolved traditions of sword making.\u21a9#p23\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p24\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Keeping the above in mind, we have to assume a use of potentially Roman imported swords alongside native products that adapted an originally Roman design for locally preferred longer blades.22 The putative identified gladii hispanienses, with their blade lengths ranging between 590/600 and 700 mm, and in individual cases achieving significantly greater lengths, thus also clearly contrast with the Roman infantry\u2019s short swords of the Roman Principate, with blade lengths mostly below 550 mm. When it comes to the above mentioned length analysis of predominantly Roman Imperial blades, the supposed gladii hispanienses must thus be classified as long swords (spathae). This apparent contradiction has raised doubts in recent literature about the accuracy of using the length 550/600 mm as the dividing threshold between short and long swords.23 However, a closer examination reveals that there is no such contradiction. The linguistic/academic distinction between gladius, alias short sword, and spatha, alias long sword, common today, essentially relies on a passage of Tacitus (Annales 12.35). In this source of the late first century AD the term spatha, which is used literarily for the first time here to characterize a specific kind of sword, is contrasted with the term gladius, which was well established in literature, without any further explanation. According to Vegetius (Epitome 2.15.4),24 who refers to older written sources, the spatha is merely a gladius maior. This insight allows us to understand the specific text passage in Tacitus as offering a contrast between short and long swords. At the same time, the term gladius maior also means that while the basic word gladius referred to a \u201csword\u201d, it need not necessarily have specified a short one. It is the adjectives added to the primary word or the literary context that allow for a more precise definition. However, in the case of the gladius hispaniensis, literary sources25 just reveal that the weapon should have been shorter than contemporary Gaulish swords.26 Their blade dimensions, between 700 and 900 mm, frequently range at the upper end of the spectrum of lengths which is ascertainable for Roman Imperial long swords.27 In the early Roman Principate, i.e., in the period in which Tacitus wrote, the longest blade normally even reached the shorter length, or at the most the lower end of the described range.28 It thus appears conceivable that the gladius hispaniensis was not an explicit short sword even by ancient or at least Roman Imperial standards, but instead was a gladius maior (=spatha) with a comparatively short blade.29 At least this would be valid for the majority of the sword finds which currently appear as gladius hispaniensis in recent literature.

Self-sustaining iron scabbard frames are generally assumed to have been used by the Roman army upon Celtiberian inspiration in context with the establishment of the gladius hispaniensis,42 and recur in Roman contexts until the general abandonment of so-called \u201cframe-scabbards\u201d around the mid-first century AD. Their evidence again concentrates in the first century BC, whereas the use of copper alloy was important for more recent frame-scabbards. With respect to the frame clamps and carrying clamps (suspension bands), the shift to non-ferrous metal had apparently concluded already in the early Augustan period. This observation is supported by the circumstance that most iron scabbard frames of Roman or Roman-influenced swords from the last third of the first century BC are already combined with bronze/brass clamps43 alongside the first completely non-ferrous metal frames, as for example the Nauportus type spatha from grave 119 at Giubiasco.44 Then again, a (Nauportus type?) spatha in grave 31 (La T\u00e8ne D2) in the necropolis of San Bernardo in Ornavasso (Italy) has an iron scabbard frame (Fig. 15.1), probably combined with at least partially iron clamps and simple carrying rings.45 On the other hand, a sword from Delos), revealed beneath the debris of the destruction caused by a pirate attack in 69 BC, was equipped solely with simple iron frame clamps and carrying clamps (suspension bands), holding together a pure leather scabbard with a leather frame (Fig. 14.4).46 For a closer chronological classification of the scabbard frame that belongs to the spatha from Soknopaiou Nesos, its pure iron composition \u2013so far as this is reconstructable \u2013 as well as the shape of its terminal knob can be taken into account (Fig. 11, 13). The separately produced spherical knob with a horizontal groove all round and the nozzle-shaped neck seem to vaguely anticipate the structuring or fastening traits common, although more elaborate and diverse, to many of the mainly non-ferrous metal terminal knobs of scabbard bindings of the early Roman Principate.47\u21a9#p30\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p31\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "To sum up, a date for the frame-scabbard from Soknopaiou Nesos to the period between the mid-first century BC and the early Augustan period seems plausible.\u21a9#p31\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p32\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Without doubt, the most remarkable elements of the sword presented here are the remaining parts of its hilt, i.e., the pommel and what is left of its grip.\u21a9#p32\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p33\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "What is unusual about the grip is the fact that it is simply made of cloth wrapped around the tang (Fig. 12.1). Judging from other swords of the Roman Principate, one would most probably have expected a Roman or Roman-influenced sword to have a solid, tube-shaped, wood or bone grip sleeve, slid onto the tang (Fig. 16.1\u20132).48 Among the earliest archaeologically attested Roman grips of this kind are cylindrical to barrel-shaped grip sleeves with their surface decorated with parallel grooves/cannelures running along the axis of the grip or spirally around it (Fig. 16.1). A relatively homogenous group of similarly produced grips, with a certain chronological concentration in the Augustan and Tiberian period, presumably draws on Republican traditions.49 The census-relief of the so-called Ara of Domitius Ahenobarbus in Rome (late second to first half of the first century BC)50 shows Roman soldiers, and a depiction of a sword grip with similar cannelures (Fig. 17), possibly supporting the aforementioned hypothesis. On the other hand, we cannot exclude that the spiral groove of this stone relief may just mean a simple textile or leather band wrapped tightly around the blade tang. Ultimately, it is conceivable that even the similarly arranged groups of grooves on the surface of the solid grip sleeve at the beginning of the Roman Principate represent an abstract decorative adaptation of an originally real wrapped feature. If we accept this last suggestion, the singularity of the remains of the sword grip from Soknopaiou Nesos could simply result from a modern research gap caused by the perishable character of the wrapping material.\u21a9#p33\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p34\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Lastly, the classification of the pommel made of ebony is no less problematic (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). The contours of its front side present a shape that is so far mainly familiar from ancient reliefs. Worth mentioning are, for example, the early hilts of Celtic warriors on Etruscan monuments, as for example a stela from the Certosa necropolis in Bologna, ancient Felsina,  ([Fig. 18] second half of the fifth century BC);51 or the hilts of captured Galatian arms on the balustrade screens in the Athena sanctuary from Pergamon ([Fig. 19.2\u20132a] around 183 BC),52 and finally representations of swords in the context of late Republican to early Imperial Roman army equipment, as for instance on the epitaph of the centurion Minucius in Padua (Fig. 20, ca. 44\u201342 BC)53 or the relief blocks of a pillar tomb with the scene of an equestrian combat from Arlon (Belgium [Fig. 21] ca. third quarter of the first century AD).54 Both the latter monument, possibly representing Gaulish auxiliary cavalry of the Roman army, and the Pergamene arms reliefs or monuments such as the stela from Bologna, which ought to be considered alongside further Italian representations of barbaric warriors with similar sword hilts,55 could support the hypothesis that such hilts were inspired by Celtic armament. This had similarly structured metal hilt elements, both three-dimensional objects (Fig. 22.2)56 \u2013 especially on the so-called \u201cKnollenknaufschwerter\u201d with knobbly pommels (Fig. 22.3)57 \u2013 as well as riveted elements on the front side combined with hilt components made of organic material (Fig. 22.1),58 as is evidenced already for the late Hallstatt/early Lat\u00e8ne period. Irrespective of the fact that the so-called gladius hispaniensis is the adaptation of a special blade shape from Celtiberian armament, it seems questionable whether Celtic hilt forms developed such a great impact as to have the centurion Minucius in Padua (Fig. 20) and numerous other Roman officers be depicted on Italian funerary or honorary monuments of the first century BC with similarly designed sword- or dagger-pommels.59 Examples are, among others, the reliefs in Modena (Italy; [Fig. 23] ca. second half of the first century BC),60 in Mentana (Italy; [Fig. 24] 40\u201330 BC),61 in Isernia (Italy; around 27 BC)62 or in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (ca. last quarter of the first century BC).63 It is striking that \u2013 apart from the relevant hilts \u2013 the other equipment presented on the mentioned monuments, or more precisely, the armament and the clothing (such as linothoraces or muscle cuirasses, pteryges and paludamenta) and \u2013 as far as identifiable \u2013 also the manner of bearing the sword on the balteus display unequivocal Hellenistic-Italic traditions. Occasionally, this connection is even unquestionable for the hilt of the sword/dagger, as for example on an Augustan epitaph in the Carlsberg Glypothek in Copenhagen.64 As on the above-mentioned relief from Mentana (Fig. 24), the officer is represented with nothing but a draped paludamentum in otherwise heroic nudity. He thus carries on the tradition of the idealized Hellenistic image of the ruler,65 which in this case is further emphasised by the hilt of a Graeco-Italian xiphos. Following on from the strong Hellenistic influences, evident in the aforementioned Roman relief depictions, we are confronted with the question whether spherical structured forms of pommels actually ought to be stressed as an element which emanates from Celtic influence, or whether Hellenistic armament can have had similar pommels. In the absence of significant archaeological finds from Eastern Mediterranean contexts of the third to the first century BC, we cannot give a secure answer to this question. At least the tang of the sword from Delos (terminus ante quem around 69 BC)66 mentioned above (Fig. 14.4), with its preserved mushroom- or ball-headed rivets from the fitting of a previously organic pommel, could represent a suitable clue, if we were to consider that the piece need not necessarily be an imported Roman weapon.67 We can perhaps gather the best impression of the former appearance of this pommel by consulting early Roman Imperial reliefs from the oasis town of Palmyra, which show armed gods in an hybrid Hellenistic-oriental style (e.g., Fig. 26).68 On top of the local costume, these gods wear pteryges, and finally also a muscle cuirass or, alternatively, an oriental lamellar armor resembling Hellenistic linothorax (including fascia and chlamys). According to oriental custom, the sword is mostly fixed to a narrow waist belt but has a frame-scabbard with two carrying clamps (suspension bands), corresponding to early Roman Imperial weapons. In so far as discernible, the hand-guards of these swords often demonstrate a more or less high angular shape, such as those represented already on Greek weapons on the balustrade screens (Fig. 19.2b\u2013c) from Pergamon \u00a0(ca. 183 BC)69 or on eastern Greek epitaph reliefs from the second to first century BC (Fig. 25).70 Most probably, the shape is to be interpreted as a reminiscence of the wide angular scabbard lockets of traditional Graeco-Italic xiph\u0113.71 The oriental and Mediterranean details of costume and armor are now joined and complemented by \u201cknobbly\u201d sword pommels, which are represented en masse on Palmyrene reliefs of gods of the late first century BC to first century AD. According to the proportions of the individual \u201cknobs\u201d to one another, here, too, we can observe both depictions which \u2013 regarding the sword from Delos \u2013 could indicate an organic spherical pommel with a fitting of metal mushroom- or ball-headed rivets,72 as well as depictions in which the exterior contours and interior composition of the front side perfectly correspond to the preserved ebony pommel of the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). The most striking examples in this context are provided by the much cited Palmyrene relief plate (ca. first half of the first century AD) with the divine triad Baal-Shamin, Aglibol and Malakbel in the Louvre in Paris since 1945 (Fig. 26).73 Although we cannot exclude the possibility that Celtic south-east migrations during the third century BC74 started a massive Celtic influence on Hellenistic sword equipment, possibly continued by the Galatian colonization in central Anatolia, it has little explanatory force for the concentration of \u201cknobbly pommels\u201d in divine depictions in a Hellenistic-oriental desert metropolis.75 Unfortunately, the Palmyrene wealth of significant sword depictions from the beginning of the early Roman Principate is unique in the Parthian Empire and its peripheral areas. Even from Ptolemaic to early Roman Egypt, no contemporary illustrations of swords seem to be available, as far as the authors know, which indicates once more that the \u201cknobbly pommels\u201d could have been usual elements of a late Hellenistic oriental form tradition or merely that they were frequently used in the region in question, respectively the Fayyum or even the closer surroundings of Soknopaiou Nesos.76 Related considerations notwithstanding, a miniature sword/dagger (Fig. 27; SO12/-/3852) of lead (length just above 6 cm) which evokes Celtic-influenced late Iron Age sword hilts (Fig. 15,4),77 was found near the Southern wall of the temenos in Soknopaiou Nesos and was possibly once donated as a votive.78 The bent design of its grip/hand-guard79 could serve as a reminder that the possibility of Celtic/Galatian foreign influences should not be ignored entirely even in the Fayyum.80\u21a9#p34\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p35\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Irrespective of the above discussion, the choice of ebony as the material for the sword pommel of the weapon from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11, Fig. 12) does not seem to suggest an import from Europe or Asia Minor. A closer inspection reveals, in addition, that the model and comparable examples for its entire form can ultimately not be established in the La T\u00e8ne milieu. This becomes apparent as soon as the pommel is regarded not just from the front, and the barely lat\u00e8noide spindle-shaped/cylindrical shape of the lateral \u201cknobs\u201d can be appreciated more clearly. Viewed from above (Fig. 11.2, 12.2\u20133), the piece has contours rather like the head of a hammer. Surprisingly, an intensive review of Egyptian small finds has directed us to a group of rare objects, which are entirely or partially similar to the presented sword pommel, not just looking from the top, but also from the front. However, these small finds are manufactured of stone or of bone, and, according to W. M. Flinders Petrie,81 they are interpreted as pre-dynastic mace-heads. While many of these finds cannot be dated with greater precision, the damaged longitudinal half of a similar \u201cknobbed mace-head\u201d of green serpentine (Fig. 28), found in 2006 in grave 26 (ca. first half of the fourth millennium BC; Naqada period II) in the pre-dynastic elite necropolis HK6 at Hierakonpolis,82 seems to preliminarily confirm this dating. Three further \u201cknobbed mace-heads\u201d made of quartz (Fig. 29.1a\u2013b; height: 47 mm), calcite (Fig. 29.2a\u2013b; width/height: 77 x 70 mm) and of dark green steatite (Fig. 29.3a\u2013b; width/height: 69 x 55 mm),83 were acquired on the Egyptian antiquities market in Upper Egypt by the Egyptian collection of University College London.84 They seem to be more of less exact analogies to the sword pommel from Soknopaiou Nesos, but made of stone. At least three further good parallels are stored in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.85 One of them (Fig. 30, J.E. 25554) consists of green-black stone (presumably serpentine; width/height/depth: ca. 72 x 55 x 49 mm) and was found in Luxor/Thebai. The other two old finds (J.E. 45047) are from Mit Rahina/Memphis (1914) and are made of ivory (Fig. 31; width/height/depth: ca. 67 x 56 x 44\u201345 mm) and bone (Fig. 32; perhaps horse bone; width/height/depth: ca. 80 x 75 x 54\u201355 mm). The remains of small iron nails and discoloration from corrosion in the latter example (Fig. 32) show that the cancellous bone protruding from both narrow sides was covered by non-ferrous metal sheets. Unfortunately, there is no further information on the find contexts of the three pieces in the Cairo Egyptian Museum, as was the case for the London collection. The \u201cknobbed mace-heads\u201d represent a comparatively insignificant number within the spectrum of the shapes of Egyptian mace-heads.86 Their appearance is attributed to Near Eastern influences in the first half of the fourth millennium BC.87 Literature, partly dating back nearly a century,88 has referred to the Near Eastern knobbed mace-heads from Susa, Iraq (Fig. 33; final fifth / early fourth millennium BC)89 and from grave 114 at Tepe Gawra near Khorsabad (Iraq, ca. 4000\u20133800 BC)90 as the ideal examples or predecessors of the Egyptian ones. However, these objects are essentially rather representatives of the large group of \u201cpear-shaped mace-heads\u201d with mainly smooth surfaces, including three to four semi-spherically protruding round to oval bumps, almost resembling applications. Even though a \u201cpear-shaped mace-head\u201d made of pink limestone and with three knobs from the Naqada-II-period grave 3740 at Badari91 may support the idea of the influence of these Near Eastern knobbed mace-heads on the Egyptian development of mace-heads, it does not suffice to determine a coherent line of development toward those Egyptian examples with more strongly subdivided forms like those in the sword hilt from Soknopaiou Nesos.92 Nevertheless, because of the mentioned fragments of mace-heads from grave 26 (HK6) from \nHierakonpolis (Fig. 28) the appearance of this shape as early as the fourth millennium BC cannot be argued away.\u21a9#p35\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p36\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "In light of the above observations, we must of course face the question of how the existence of a sword pommel of identical design can be explained in an almost four millennia younger weapon.\u21a9#p36\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p37\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "An initially intuitive explanation could be that a mace-head that was already an antiquity in the Ptolemaic/Augustan period, possibly having been dug up from the ground, could have been mounted in secondary usage to a contemporary sword due to its pleasing form or other motivations. However, the numerous depictions of comparable pommels on contemporary Roman and Hellenistic/oriental monuments discussed above necessarily refute this explanation. What is more, a range of locally produced Ptolemaic to early Roman miniature swords/daggers of terracotta are known from Egypt, some of which present comparable pommel shapes to that of the sword of Soknopaiou Nesos, including an attached, horizontally ribbed grip (possibly imitating a wrapped feature?). The finds from an apparently Hellenistic terracotta workshop in the eastern part (site no. 9[5]) of the antique Naukratis near An-Nibayrah93 are just one example (Fig. 34). Bearing this in mind, we must rather question whether the one or the other object is similarly a pommel of Hellenistic to Roman dating, rather than, as interpreted so far, a pre-dynastic \u201cknobbed mace-head.\u201d Such a function is readily conceivable for the two bone examples from the Cairo Egyptian Museum (Fig. 31, Fig. 32), and it should not be entirely excluded even for stone representatives. This way, we can trace the use of sword elements made of stone (among others, scabbard-slides, hand-guards and pommels), which originate from middle- or east Asian influences, in the North Pontic, South Russian area and in the Near East throughout the entire Roman Imperial period.94 It is noteworthy that some of the presumably pre-dynastic Egyptian \u201cknobbed mace-heads\u201d contrast to the majority of the other forms of mace-heads by their common feature of a shaft hole, clearly conical to the upper point of emergence, and markedly angular to rectangular at the lower end. The majority have a pierced drill hole, which is straight, only slightly conical or even vaguely hourglass-shaped at the mounting, with a round cross section. This peculiarity could obviously simply be intended to prevent an arbitrary contortion of the \u201cknobbed mace-head\u201d out of its shaft because of its special, irregular design. Still, we must observe that these angular and conical drilled passages correspond to the ideal design of a tang\u2019s passage on early to middle Roman Imperial sword pommels of Roman style. Such considerations notwithstanding, the question remains whether there were circumstances that induced the long survival of an evidently pre-dynastic form of mace-head until its deployment as a pommel for a late Ptolemaic to early Augustan weapon. The importance of the mace as a symbol of power and domination in the Near East and Egypt seems the only conceivable explanation.95 This role lies beind the use of the mace as a consistent component of the attributes of oriental deities.96 Assuming this much, there is finally the question whether the mace-head, the characteristic element of this symbol of power, was shifted from the shaft of a mace to the tang of a sword in the course of an iconographic change in the images of the gods. The accumulation of knobbly pommels or those similar to knobbed mace-heads could, in this term, be easily apprehended in relation with depictions of deities in Palmyra (Fig. 26). This does not necessarily imply that the actual transferral of the mace-head shape, as displayed by the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11, Fig. 12), was really understood as a personal symbol of power for the respective sword-bearer. The possibly intentional divine reference could rather point to a military symbol of victory and/or assistance or an apotropaic function, as similarly discussed for Roman pendants and knife or sword hilts in the shape of \u201cHercules maces\u201d (Fig. 16.3).97 On the basis of this interpretation, the cultural reciprocity between Occident and Orient during Alexander\u2019s campaigns, or the subsequent empires of Alexander\u2019s successors, might have facilitated an adaptation and western diffusion of the \u201cknobbed mace-head\u201d/knobbly pommel form by means of the Hellenistic sword armament, up to the depiction of \u201cknobbly\u201d sword hilts on monuments in late Republican Italy.\u21a9#p37\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p38\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "The shape and dimensions of the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11) suggest a classification as a spatha of the Nauportus type.

It remains substantially unclear how and when the design of Hellenistic swords possibly picked up certain developments and inspirations from the western Mediterranean area, particularly Spain and Italy, but also Gaul, and to which degree these inspirations were related to Greek traditions and potentially oriental influences.98 In this respect, we must be aware that the partial or full classification of a few swords found in East Mediterranean sites of the Hellenistic period, such as from a grave in Jericho (West Bank; [Fig. 14.3]; ca. first half of the second century BC)99 and from the settlement finds in Delos (Fig. 14.4; terminus ante quem 69 BC),100 as Roman gladii hispanienses is quite precarious.101 Otherwise the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos would now theoretically be the third contextualized \u201cforeign find\u201d of this kind in the eastern Mediterranean, while an example of the \u201cregular\u201d late Hellenistic swords, which should be used by the majority in that region during the mentioned time, would be so far completely unknown to scholarship. However, the blade of the weapon from Soknopaiou Nesos has the dimensions of a long sword, and even with the greatest tolerance, we can no longer assume its use by heavy Roman line infantry, i.e., by legionaries. We can consider that in the late Republican Roman army at least infantry or cavalry auxiliary contingents were mainly composed of allied peoples with still strong indigenous elements of costume and armament.102 An accurate analysis of the preserved hilt elements suggests that at least the \u201cfinal mounting\u201d of the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos presumably took place in an oriental, perhaps even Egyptian workshop. With regard to its postulated dating, it is also imaginable that it was used in the course of arming parts of late Ptolemaic troops. On the basis of this circumstance alone, special explanatory models of the sword\u2019s arrival in the Fayyum are redundant. On the other hand, countless possibilities arise \u2013 even for a weapon from a Roman armory103 \u2013 in the context of Roman-Egyptian relations and conflicts as early as the period between the reinstatement of Ptolemy XII (80\u201351) in 55 BC, possible thanks to a Roman military intervention, and the establishment of Egypt as a Roman province in 30 BC.\u21a9#p38\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p39\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Soknopaiou Nesos itself was, nevertheless, neither a settlement under military influence, nor one displaying evidence for a military installation in its surroundings, which could directly associate the sword with a garrison. The settlement was essentially inhabited by Egyptians,104 and most of the activities represented in papyri are related to the temple, trade, and the breeding of camels. Roman soldiers are mentioned in second and third-century AD papyri with the function of supervising affairs within the kome and of receiving materials for the army by the local priests.105 The last transactions are witnessed by regular receipts.106 A number of petitions from Soknopaiou Nesos (first to third century AD) are addressed to a centurio, but it is unclear where these centurions lived.107 The presence of soldiers in many villages of the Fayyum, both from the Ptolemaic period and the Roman Principate, is well known from papyri and other written sources. In this context, the find of a Hellenistic or Roman sword in Soknopaiou Nesos should not really come as a surprise, regardless of whether members of the army lived in the town or not. In addition, the place of discovery of the weapon, i.e., within the temenos of the main temple, could be significant for the question of the function it served in its last phase. It cannot be stressed enough that the find context was not reliable from an archaeological point of view, as the sword was no longer in its original place of deposition, but instead displaced secondarily, possibly even in recent times. The same can be stressed for the other archaeological contexts where a few other militaria have been found, like an iron and a bronze arrowhead (ST10/706/3346 and ST12/851/3991) of different shapes and dating, as well as the above mentioned miniature lead sword (Fig. 27; SO12/-/3852).108 It is nevertheless not questionable that all these weapons have been found inside the temenos.\u21a9#p39\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p40\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "In short, there are two possible explanations of the final function of the sword. Either it was an \u201cactive\u201d weapon until its deposition somewhere in the temenos, belonging to the defensive repertoire of the settlement and/or the sanctuary, or it was a votive object dedicated to the temple, maybe exhibited for a certain time, and then stored in an adjoining building (ST 21?) or, perhaps, ritually buried.109\u21a9#p40\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p41\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "In the first case, we have to assume that the sword was discarded as an obsolete weapon, given its date and the long life of the settlement, which was abandoned in the mid-third century AD.

Nonetheless, this does not exclude the possibility of a much earlier date for its dedication and removal from the original exhibition place already during the renovation of the temple at the end of the Ptolemaic/beginning of the Roman period.112\u21a9#p42\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#p43\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "All these considerations are merely speculative until future excavations will possibly yield new finds in more reliable contexts that can illuminate the meaning of the presence of weapons within the temple precinct, as well as the significance of the presence of soldiers in Soknopaiou Nesos.\u21a9#p43\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/9/#work-cited-1\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Alston, R. 1995.

A kiln-site producing the form near Porto Cheli in the southern Argolid is dated by the presence of ARS, PRS and a coin of the emperor Phocas (602-610).21 That region\u2019s workshops produced vessels with an identifiable pinkish fabric and a beige surface.22 The fabric of many of the LRA2 rims, other diagnostics, and body sherds from the Threpsiades excavations is likely of or closely related to this Argolid variety, which has also been identified at Corinth. A further indication that Kenchreai is within one of the multiple active regions of LRA2 production and use comes from the Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey (EKAS), whose members recognized that combed body sherds were among the most abundant Late Roman artifact categories.23 When one considers LRA2 broadly, the recent publication of kilns at Dilesi in Boeotia adds to the increasing firm evidence that production was widespread.24\u21a9#p14\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/10/#p15\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "There is diversity among the LRA2 vessels from the Threpsiades complex.

We have not refit body sherds, but we note the predominance of deep wavy combing. It is of interest that some LRA2 body sherds bear black characters or symbols. These markings are distinct from the red dipinti that are not uncommon on LRA2 vessels. These preliminary observations suggest directions for future study.

That industry also produced specialized forms such as the funnels that allowed liquids to be poured into or out of amphoras. We can assert with confidence that such handling of liquid goods took place at Kenchreai.

This one locus of activity at Early Byzantine Kenchreai has a place in the regional narrative of long-term change.51 The construction of the Hexamilion, a defensive wall stretching across the Isthmus not far north of the harbor, in the early fifth century signals the evolving strategic circumstances of the Empire. Justinian (527-565) initiated a campaign of repair to the Isthmian fortifications and the addition of towers. This massive operation precedes by perhaps only a few decades the activity at Kenchreai represented by the finewares and amphoras from Threpsiades. Justinian\u2019s military construction anticipated the real threat of incursion by the Avars and Slavs in the 580s. We use the generic term \u201cSlavs\u201d for new settlers whose arrival in Macedonia, central Greece, and the Peloponnese from the northern Balkans marked new circumstances for local communities.52 The main port on the closest major Saronic island, Aegina, sustained a sizable community represented by monumental architecture and a diverse range of artifacts into the seventh century.53 Only a few kilometers north of Kenchreai, the coastal establishment at Akra Sophia was active during the sixth century and probably into the seventh.54 The published LRA2 and beehive sherds, together with scattered fineware and structural remains, suggest this was a rural villa of sorts with opulent residential space and a small harborage, combining luxurious living with commercial engagement.55 Moreover, the countryside north and west of Kenchreai and across the central Isthmus has been systematically explored by the Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey in 1999-2002.56 Close analysis of surface ceramics has led to the conclusion that this rural space remained economically vibrant throughout the sixth century and that such activity then diminished over the course of the seventh and eighth.57\u21a9#p27\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/10/#p28\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "By the middle to late sixth century, the commercial capacity of the port at Kenchreai was declining from its Early to Middle Roman heyday.

It also seems that the two moles were submerged during coseismic subsidence in Late Antiquity, thus permanently altering the built landscape of the port.

We suspect that many of the LRA2s, particularly the large ones, were destined to be shipped out from Kenchreai, perhaps containing Corinthian commodities. The ships that would have carried them away may well have been the same ones that brought the eastern amphoras, the ARS and the PRS, and glass vessels to the port. Such imports could have been sent off to consumers on coastal or rural settlements, such as the villas at Akra Sophia or on the central Isthmus, or the larger market at Corinth.

However, the excavators saved the copious larger fragments by context (typically by room number and then by stratum) and stored them in plastic bags in the hypaithrio of the Isthmia Museum, which was newly constructed in 1976-1977. Workers for the Archaeological Service reorganized the contents of the hypaithrio in 2002-2003, at which time they transferred the finds from the deteriorating and melting plastic bags into new grocers\u2019 crates. The Corinthian Ephoreia has informed us that around this time, as part of the consolidation and reorganization of the government\u2019s storage in the region, a portion of the finds from the Threpsiades property equaling as much as 25% of the total was removed to Archaia Korinthos and buried in an effort to conserve space.

The device was mounted on a small cap, rotating with the lunar sidereal period, to which the (lost) moon pointer was probably attached. See Figure 2.

Inside the collar the CT shows a small radiodense globule, almost spherical, with a diameter of roughly 1 mm, whose significance is not clear to us if it is not simply a bit of free metal that was protected from corrosion by the thickness of the collar (Figure 10, reference 6).

One is that the moon cap was never reinstalled on the Mechanism after the contrate gear was unintentionally reversed. But this is implausible, first because the moon cap is extant in fragment C, close to the zodiac and calendar rings, and second because the cap faces in the correct direction with respect to the outer part of the mechanism and the inscribed part of the rings face, which seems to indicate that it was in place at the moment of the shipwreck. Secondly, someone might have tried to force the cap into place, causing still more damage (as suggested by Wright 2006: 327), but this requires that the person responsible, feeling the resistance, was too careless to look for what was wrong and notice the obvious fact that the contrate was facing the wrong way to engage with the other gear. The third possibility is that the moon cap was indeed reassembled, but the gear attached to the solar arbor was for some unexplained reason also missing, but this is clearly an ad hoc hypothesis.

Gears z and y have the same number of teeth, as do gears u and x. u moves x by engagement, and x moves y by means of a pin inserted in a slot of y. Therefore, x and y rotate at the same rate but, because y is eccentric with respect to x, its motion is not uniform. This non-uniform motion is transmitted by engagement from y to z. Consequently z rotates at the same rate as u, but with a non-uniform motion.

The only possibilities are a modification of the period, which is out of the question for a display of the lunar phases, or a periodic modification of the moon ball's rate of rotation\u2014in other words, a modification of the symmetrical periodic function that would otherwise correlate the appearance of the lunar phase to the moon's elongation from the sun. (Strictly, we should not speak without qualification of a change from uniform to non-uniform motion, since the elongation displayed on the Mechanism was already affected by the lunar anomaly, though likely not by the solar anomaly14.) And the only historically plausible anomalistic effect would have been the one produced by the ratio of the distances of the sun and moon. Incorporating this effect would have provided a way of including one of the main topics of ancient astronomy at least since Aristotle\u2019s time, the distances of the luminaries, which would not otherwise have been present in the mechanism. Their relative distances would have been displayed qualitatively by the fact that the moon ball was closer to the dial's center (representing the earth) than the \"golden little sphere\" that apparently was mounted on the sun's pointer, but it would have been impracticable to set these spheres at the assumed ratio of their distances. If the Antikythera mechanism was intended as a teaching device (Jones 2012), a moon phase anomalistic device would thus have been a suitable springboard for explaining the luminaries' distances.\u21a9#p49\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-papers-awdl/11/#p50\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Previously, the pin and slot device has only been suggested as a mechanical expression of an epicyclic or eccentric geometrical system, which have no obvious relevance for lunar phases. There is, however, an isomorphism between the mechanical and the astronomical configuration. Figure 16 represents the hypothetical pin and slot device for producing the moon phase anomaly, considered in a frame of reference such that the axes E of the driving gear and M of the driven gear are stationary. The pin, S, thus revolves around axis E uniformly (relative to the motion that directly drives it) with the synodic period. The slot (in dashed lines) revolves around the other axis, M, with the same period, but with a non-uniform motion. The non-uniform motion of the slot represents the moon phase anomaly. This mechanical configuration has an astronomical interpretation: E represents the Earth; M, the Moon, and S, the Sun, in a frame of reference such that the Earth and Moon are both stationary, so that the Sun revolves around the Earth at a rate equal to the difference between its own sidereal speed and the moon's sidereal speed, i.e. with the lunar synodic period. The angle that represents the moon's phases is angle SME, i.e., the angle at the Moon between the Earth and the Sun, and the rate of increase of this angle incorporates a non-uniformity because the Sun revolves around the Earth and not around the Moon. In order to produce the correct anomaly, the proportion between the interaxial distance ME and the distance between the pin, S and its axis, E, should be the same as the proportion between the Earth-Moon distance and the Earth-Sun distance.

It is certainly significant that these works were executed at the same time that the larger temple of Thoth at Amheida was being built and decorated. At Trimithis, the builders made use of the stones from the temples of the Late Period, which were being demolished to make room for the new buildings.

The growth in accurate knowledge of the chronology of oasis pottery in the last two decades has led to the redating of some wares found in the DOP's survey of the oasis, which has led in turn to the identification of more Ptolemaic sites at places once thought to be only Roman.18 Consequently, the rise in habitation sites from Ptolemaic to Roman seems a bit less marked now than it did when the survey was carried out during 1977\u20131987, but it is still evident that growth in the Roman period was striking. The Egyptian oases are far from being the only parts of the Roman Near East to witness expansion to such unprecedented levels of occupation, often not matched even in modern times. Given the high cost of overland transport in antiquity\u2014a theme familiar to anyone with even a passing acquaintance with ancient economic history\u2014one might well wonder how such growth was possible. Why would anyone settle in so remote and seemingly forbidding a place as Dakhla? And how could people earn a living there, let alone become rich? Furthermore, why would rich people from outside the oasis invest there?\u21a9#p47\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter1.xhtml#p48\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "The oases are constituted essentially of soil and water, plus some stone in outcroppings and the bordering scarp, mostly sandstone of moderate quality. Actually, that description sounds at first blush like much of the Nile valley, too. But in the valley it was relatively easy to supply anything not available locally, because transportation on the great river was cheap; for the same reason it was easy to export the agricultural produce of the valley's rich soil to places from which other goods were to be acquired. The oases lacked this cheap and easy transportation network. By ancient direct road, Dakhla is about 365 km from the valley at its closest point; by the less strenuous route allowing a stop in Kharga, it is still farther. What, then, was the economic landscape generated by the economy (described in \u00a76.1) and embedded in the natural landscape described in \u00a71.1?\u21a9#p48\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter1.xhtml#p49\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "First, it required significant capital investment. Without investment in the infrastructure of wells and water-distribution systems, the oasis was just so much empty desert. Even if natural pressure was in most cases sufficient to bring the water to or near the surface, wells needed to be dug to the water-bearing strata. We do not know what the cost of digging a well and supplying it with control and distribution systems was, but one ostrakon from Trimithis (O.Trim. 1.19) suggests that the gross annual revenue from the use of a well's water was in the neighborhood of 50 gold solidi, or more than two-thirds of a pound of gold. The capital value may thus have been something like five to six pounds of gold, a very large sum and far beyond the reach of most Egyptians. As far as we can see, these wells were privately owned, and there is no evidence for the assertion sometimes encountered that the expansion of irrigation in the oasis was driven by central-government planning. Rather, the wells represent massive private investment. But because that investment was so massive, it must represent the activity of a relatively small number of rich individuals or families, not a broad-gauged movement. This fact will be important in thinking about the society of the oasis (\u00a76.4).\u21a9#p49\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter1.xhtml#p50\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Second, the oasis landscape, as we noted in \u00a71.1, is not one of continuous cultivation\u2014a green expanse in the middle of the desert\u2014but of plantings clustered around the wells. Sometimes these wells were, and still are, close to one another; but in other instances there are large stretches of desert between the islands of cultivation. This patchy landscape can still be seen today, and was much more prominent even a decade or so back, before the sprawl of deep wells dug in recent years. Wells and their settlements formed zones around the major population centers like Trimithis, Kellis, Mothis, and Mesobe. The economic landscape was thus one requiring plenty of local transportation to connect up the centers of production and dwelling. Not only were many long-distance camel caravans required to export the oasis products to the valley, but armies of donkeys, and their drivers, were needed to keep the extended territory of the oasis working as a unit. Indeed, the landscape was thick with this traffic of donkeys, which are ubiquitous in the papyri and ostraka.\u21a9#p50\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter1.xhtml#p51\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Around the wells was a complex array of cultivations. Because distance and transport costs made it uneconomical to provide the people of the oasis with staple crops from the valley, the oasis had to be self-supporting in basic foodstuffs like wheat, barley, legumes, and vegetables; to that list may be added ordinary wine. Although high-quality wine was often an item of interregional trade, everyday drink was too bulky and not valuable enough to make overland transport as far as Dakhla a reasonable proposition. The arable crops were grown in small basins watered via channels from the wells. We know that along with the more familiar food crops just mentioned the oasis fields grew millet and cotton in the summer, at a time when the Nile valley was under water. The landscape was thus seasonally variable, but in a different way from the valley. The arable plantings were probably inexpensive to maintain once the water-supply infrastructure was in place. Their value no doubt varied, cotton being the most valuable because exportable and, at least once spun into thread, high in value proportionate to bulk.\u21a9#p51\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter1.xhtml#p52\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Alongside these field crops, and perhaps in part interspersed with them, were large numbers of trees.

In the oases, by contrast, the water flowed 365 days a year and never flooded the trees' roots. Not only the vineyards but also the date palms and olive trees benefited from this geography, and these were the source of the high-value fruits exported for cash. They also, of course, are another form of investment, requiring some patience for eventual returns, as dates and olives, in particular, take years to produce their potential yields.\u21a9#p52\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter1.xhtml#p53\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "One major drawback of not experiencing the Nile flood, however, was an acute need for fertilizer.

For the vineyards and orchards, fertilizer meant dung: dung from the cattle tethered in the fields, human night-soil, and above all droppings from the millions of pigeons raised in the striking farm buildings that are a staple feature of ancient rural sites throughout the oases. These buildings (Fig. 22, Fig. 23) are largely of standard plan, with side-by-side vaulted storage rooms on the ground floor and pigeon quarters on the upper level.

After centuries of stratification it formed a kom or tell, at present the central hill on top of which the successive temples of Thoth were built, culminating in the temple of the first century CE. The Roman-period temple was dismantled, probably in Ottoman times, along with several walls and buildings, to acquire construction material. A great temenos with an irregular perimeter wall originally surrounded the sacred area, which was probably entered by three gates on the east, north, and west sides. According to a virtual reconstruction of the Roman temple\u2014based on limited evidence, it must be said\u2014it was oriented toward the southeast.

The reutilized blocks (spolia) were placed mainly in the core of the walls, sometimes together with the blocks originally abutting them, as is evident in the case of some decorated items (Fig. 87). Because of this massive recycling, the wall masonry, comprising stones of different shapes and sizes, was neither uniform nor solid. For this reason great quantities of gypsum mortar and sandstone chips were used to fill the gaps between the blocks.1 The newly worked blocks are of small and medium size, the outer surfaces having been cut with rough bosses, a well known building technique used in Egypt since the Late Period. Not all the external walls had been smoothed, as some bosses with \"pilgrim grooves\" (gouges where visitors have scraped out a bit of stone to use for healing or other magical purposes) testify. Dovetail joints are rare, as is evidence of anathyrosis (the hollowing-out of joint beds).

Originally treated as an exclusively royal prerogative, from the mid-18th Dynasty (about 1400 BCE) onwards\u2014when the royals had stopped building pyramids for themselves\u2014small versions of these regal monuments came to adorn private tombs. The last royal ones were steep, at an angle of approximately 60 degrees, and the private pyramids adopted the same, as at Amheida, or a similar angle. It seems that the larger pyramids of earlier times were built at a lesser angle owing to their size. The Bent Pyramid at Dahshur, erected by King Snofru, shows clearly that a steep 54-degree angle was attempted but given up around the halfway point; the top section is built at an angle of 43 degrees, which would become the norm henceforth. The private pyramids being smaller, it became possible to realize the ideal steeper angle in them (Fig. 92). The tips of obelisks seem to reflect the same concept, in that they too were always steep. Some private pyramids of the New Kingdom were built on a small podium, and others on the roof of a funerary chapel. A few were solid, but most seem to have contained a chapel, which is why so many of them have collapsed and disappeared. The Theban necropolis of the New Kingdom must have been dominated by the bright whitewashed pyramids of its many tomb chapels. There is no evidence for pyramid buildings from the Libyan period of Dynasties 21\u201324, but the kings of the 25th Dynasty, who hailed from the Sudan, took up the pyramid for themselves and their wives.

In fact, man is usually presented as his own pilot, while life and its troubles are regarded as the waves of a tempest. Thus the Cappadocian Fathers, who frequently employ the phrase, encourage man to overcome the waves of misfortune they encounter, becoming their own pilots of their life; for example, Gregory of Nyssa, in his On Virginity, says that the good man, \"like a good pilot with his boat, looks only up to heaven in guiding his life.\" Like Dio, however, John Chrysostom, in his On Genesis (In Genesim 53.118.16), regards God as the pilot: \"We navigate through the sea of our present life, led by the great pilot, God.\"\u21a9#p213\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter5.xhtml#p214\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Ammon, the Greek form of the name of the Egyptian god Amun, was the dominant traditional god of the oases.

To the south of the church, and built against it, was a square room ending with a semicircular apse along its east side. This space, unconnected with the main building, was accessible through a narrow room outside the south apse. The south room, bearing traces of painted plaster, was possibly built shortly after the church itself and functioned as part of the same structure. The complex, measuring about 17.5 \u00d7 15.5 m (including both the church and the south room), shows evidence of architectural alterations, which include the addition of later walls near the southwest corner of the church and the entrance to the south room. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the church originally stood in isolation or among other buildings. The dating of the church, too, is uncertain. However, the data gathered from the test trenching, and from examining the church's layout, suggest a significantly later construction period for the Deir el-Molouk church than for the others excavated or surveyed in Dakhla.\u21a9#p243\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter5.xhtml#p244\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "In 2009, Kamel Bayoumi of Dakhla's Islamic and Coptic Inspectorate found another church, this one at the site of \u02bfAin es-Sabil, less than 1.5 km southwest of the archaeological site of Kellis.

The situation as regards the trade routes via the two main ports, Myos Hormos and Berenike, to points south and east, above all to India, is slightly more complex.

But it is hard to see how it can account for the enormous agricultural growth in the oasis, because the manpower needed for alum extraction would not have been large.

One part consisted of crops grown for local consumption by humans or animals, or for disbursement in payment for services rendered\u2014mainly wheat, barley, fodder crops, and wine. The other part was provided by high-value tree crops: olives, mainly in the processed form of olive oil; dates; figs; and jujubes.

What all of these products have in common is that they could have been transported to the valley by camel without their cost to the purchaser there being increased by more than 10\u201320 percent above the production expense, or at any rate their market value in the oasis, compared to the more than doubling of cost that would have taken place in the case of bulk commodities like wheat or wine.

Archaeobotanical evidence is not as well preserved at Trimithis as at Kellis and is still under study, but it is in general consistent with what is found at Kellis.

At least one ostrakon shows that the wells themselves were an important part of the property portfolio, as had been the case in Dakhla since the Old Kingdom, with farmers paying regular amounts of rental per day of water supply. The exact nature of the settlements around the wells is not usually made explicit, but they are called by the Egyptian word for \"water\" or \"well\", pmoun, \"the water of,\" followed by a name or description. The ostraka in the first volume resulting from the Amheida excavations contain more than forty such pmoun names.

In the ostraka from Trimithis, by contrast, the goods that were consumed locally are overwhelmingly dominant\u2014that is, grains and especially wine. The greater visibility of wine is easily explained: grain traveled in sacks, wine in jars with labels set into the stoppers.

I showed in a recent article that all of our papyrological evidence for cotton production in Roman Egypt comes from or concerns the western oases;8 it was also being grown in Lower Nubia around Qasr Ibrim, as John Peter Wild has demonstrated.9 But the Nile valley in Egypt seems not at that time to show any signs of cotton-growing\u2014and this is actually no surprise but a near-inevitability, for cotton is a summer crop, and Egypt's arable land was not available during most of the summer because it was under water. Only after the Nile's flood receded could the land be sown with winter crops, especially wheat and barley, which grew well in basins moistened by the flood. In the oases, by contrast, as we noted earlier, water flowed, but did not flood, 365 days a year. It would thus have been perfectly possible to grow cotton in the oases during the summer on the land that in winter produced wheat or fodder crops.\u21a9#p257\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter6.xhtml#p258\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Moreover, that two-season advantage was not limited to cotton. Tosha Dupras has shown that the bone collagen of Kellis residents buried in the cemeteries of that village contains an isotope of carbon that cannot derive from the staple carbohydrates that are typical of the ancient Old World diet\u2014that is, wheat and barley\u2014but rather must involve maize, which as a New World crop not known in Egypt until modern times is out of the question in this context, or millet.10 And in fact, millet has been found in significant quantities at Kellis, although it is never mentioned in the documents from any of the oases, and only in one passage of Olympiodorus (FHG 4.64.33), pointed out many years ago by Guy Wagner.11 Olympiodorus tells us that millet is sometimes sowed three times a year in the oasis. We do not know if it was eaten by the people of Kellis; it is very rarely mentioned in the papyri from the Nile valley, either, and it does not seem to have been a valued part of the Egyptian diet, despite its high nutritional value and easy cooking. But its consumption could be an oasis peculiarity. Even more likely, perhaps, is that it was absorbed indirectly, through feeding it to animals whose meat or milk was then consumed by humans. But either way, it was obviously another crop that could be grown in the summer and thus allow the land to produce two crops a year, or even, as Olympiodorus says, three.\u21a9#p258\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter6.xhtml#p259\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "Some interesting conclusions may be drawn.

The additional income would essentially com-pensate for the overhead on oasis production caused by transportation costs, eliminating the built-in disadvantage that the distance of the oases from the valley gave them. Second, neither cotton nor millet is known in Egypt before Roman times, as far as I can determine.

The ability to implement such a dual strategy would have constituted a remarkable competitive advantage for the oases. The one caveat I would offer is that Bahariya Oasis, the Small Oasis of the papyri, probably was not self-sufficient in cereals. Because it was both much smaller and nearer to the valley than Dakhla, the resulting need to import was not as significant a cost for Bahariya. We have a considerable amount of evidence from customs declarations and letters of the Roman period showing that wheat was sent to the Small Oasis from the Fayyum and from Oxyrhynchos.12 It was more expensive in the oasis than in the valley, but not enough to make the economics of growing wheat in that oasis attractive.

It appears that the building of a series of fairly uniform forts at Qaret el-Tub in Bahariya, El-Deir in Kharga, and El-Qasr in Dakhla is part of the same wave of military construction in the late 280s, and continuing for a couple of decades, that we find elsewhere in Egypt.29 Nowhere is it clear whether there was any direct threat that we would describe as military, or whether instead we are dealing essentially with the assertion of control over lines of communication, plus perhaps a policing function. The building of forts in the Eastern Desert under Vespasian in the mid-70s, where before there had been unfortified stations, has been connected with the increasing nomadic raiding that is recorded in the ostraka from the station at Krokodilo, on the road from Coptos to the port of Myos Hormos.30 It is possible that the same thing was true of the Western Desert in the later third century\u2014a much more difficult environment for nomads, but also for defenders, than the Eastern Desert, because water sources do not lie as near the surface in the Western Desert as in the Eastern, meaning that a dense network of stations based on wells is not feasible.

Given the economic stratification that seems likely to have existed in oasis society, it is perhaps not surprising that the better-off, mostly the managerial class, would have been able to use that power to enter into unequal unions, perhaps with women from the tenantry.

Most teachers in antiquity did not use premises exclusively devoted to teaching, so that identifying such spaces is almost impossible. They taught in private rooms that belonged either to them or to the patrons who offered them hospitality, or they made use of such locations as temples and abandoned tombs.2 Being able to identify premises where teaching and learning occurred is thus highly unusual.\u21a9#p311\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter7.xhtml#p312\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "The literary sources often mention the advantages of studying and learning, but rarely describe the students' accommodation.

We have known that specifically purposed schools like this one existed, but identifying them, even where we know they did, has generally proven impossible. In fourth-century Antioch, the sophist Libanius ran a famous school of rhetoric. At the start of his career he made use of various private rooms; later, on becoming the official sophist of the city, he was given access to a large room in the city hall.4 Earthquakes, unfortunately, have effaced any trace of this school. Auditoria for the teaching of law existed in Berytus (modern Beirut), according to a work referred to as Expositio totius mundi et gentium.

No writing was left on the walls of these teaching halls, and no papyrus referring unquestionably to them has been preserved from the site,7 so we can extrapolate the activities of students and teachers only from the literary sources. From Zacharias, bishop of Mytilene, we learn that later in the fifth century the grammarian Horapollon and the sophists and philosophers who taught liberal studies in the city received students in their homes on certain days of the week and at the school on others.

Yet this school is unique because it presents poetic texts extraordinarily vividly and accurately. The writing in red ink that covers the walls of Room 15 displays poetry previously unknown (Fig. 120); and we can try to reconstruct what appear to be several days of school activities frozen in time, giving us a window onto ancient education in progress.

The school consists, as now identifiable, of three rooms, 15, 19, and 23, but it may be that there were originally more. Low benches were built along the walls of each room. In Room 15 they stood in front of the large dipinto that filled the wall with the elegiac distichs inscribed there (Fig. 121).10 Sitting on the benches, students could study and memorize the text, or they could stand on them to write on the plastered wall.

In effect, the walls functioned as whiteboards that could be erased and written on again: this is the only instance found in Egypt of walls used in this way in an educational setting. (Actual whitened boards, covered in gesso, were in use in Egypt from Pharaonic times and well known in the Roman period.) Not that this is very different from the way other materials functioned. For instance, students who wanted to reuse a papyrus usually inscribed their new text on the back of it and only very rarely sponged off the old one.

A rare feature of the text worth pointing out is the presence of frequent lectional signs, such as breathings, accents, and apostrophes (Fig. 123).

In the rest of the dipinto he exhorts them to follow the example of Herakles, immersing themselves in their toil. The image of education as a steep hill that students have to climb occurs in many educational contexts. In the Professor of Rhetoric by the satirist Lucian, for instance, the students reach the top of the hill of learning by various paths, more or less arduous; and rhetoric, represented as a lady that they wish to \"marry\", is waiting for them there. The young men of Trimithis must have been been familiar with the Muses, the Graces, Hermes, Herakles, and other classical deities, encountering them in the poetic texts studied at the secondary level of education with a grammarian. By calling these young men paides\u2014boys, or sons\u2014and addressing them in an educational setting, this man identifies himself as a teacher and alludes to mutual feelings of affection that distinguish the teacher\u2013student relationship.

Hermes Trismegistos, or Thoth, was not only the god of rhetoric but also the main deity of Trimithis, and the epithet megas (great) is attested for him, so that the identification appears at first possible. And yet Christian epigrammatists often applied the same epithet to the Christian God. In the first epigram, moreover, Hermes is mentioned among the deities who escort the students up the hill, so he cannot be identified with the \"god\" that the teacher invokes at the beginning, and it seems very likely that the \"god\" is the Christian God. The coexistence of mythological gods and God poses no difficulty, because in the fourth century Christians claimed for themselves the right to use a classicizing language and literature; this contest for the classical heritage lies behind the emperor Julian's edict against Christian teachers and the counterreaction of Gregory of Nazianzus, among others.\u21a9#p322\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter7.xhtml#p323\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "The plastered walls of Room 19 (Fig. 124) were inscribed with several texts, no doubt many more than the two that are preserved.

Depending on who is viewing this image, the meaning shifts: in the Christian catacombs of Rome, for example, Orpheus calming the beasts with his music became an allegory for Christ bringing harmony to the world.23 By contrast, in a domestic setting such as Serenos' house, the scene could simply be another representation of age-old Graeco-Roman literary and artistic tropes. Supporting this notion is the fact that among the plaster fragments from the west wall, a second figure in a Phrygian cap and holding a lyre was also found near Orpheus, as well as a female figure of comparable size, suggesting that the iconic image of Orpheus and the animals might have been part of a more complex narrative scene, not typical of a Christian context.

By comparison, late Roman painted domestic spaces from around the Mediterranean are much more conservative, favoring instead linear decorative systems that divide wall surfaces into flattened, geometric sectors or illustrate large expanses of imitation marble paneling or opus sectile designs, fictive pilasters or even simplified architectural settings framing floating figures both large and small.

Over time, it is my general impression, the Greek onomastic repertory in Egypt becomes impoverished; the most popular names occupy a larger share of the total\u2014the power law takes over, in mathematical terms. To a large degree this probably results from the vast popularity of Greek names that could be seen as calques of Egyptian theophoric names (Kronion for Pakoibis, for instance: \"son of Kronos\" equated to \"the man belonging to Geb\") or as sound-alikes for them (for instance, Sokrates for Sobek- names in the Fayyum, deriving from the local crocodile god).\u21a9#p363\u00a0\u00a0"], ["<a href=\"http://isawnyu.github.io/isaw-books-awdl/oasis-city-awdl/chapter7.xhtml#p364\" target=\"_new\">Read in Context</a>", "No doubt the loss of a sense of connection with the immigrants' homelands played a part as well, with those names that had a locally distinctive flavor disappearing in favor of more familiar ones.
